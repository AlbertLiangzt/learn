Preface	1
“The	1
Forsyte	1
Saga”	1
was	1
the	1
title	1
originally	1
destined	1
for	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
it	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
“The	1
Man	1
of	1
Property”;	1
and	1
to	1
adopt	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
collected	1
chronicles	1
of	1
the	1
Forsyte	1
family	1
has	1
indulged	1
the	1
Forsytean	1
tenacity	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
all	1
of	1
us.	1
The	1
word	1
Saga	1
might	1
be	1
objected	1
to	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
that	1
it	1
connotes	1
the	1
heroic	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
little	1
heroism	1
in	1
these	1
pages.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
used	1
with	1
a	1
suitable	1
irony;	1
and,	1
after	1
all,	1
this	1
long	1
tale,	1
though	1
it	1
may	1
deal	1
with	1
folk	1
in	1
frock	1
coats,	1
furbelows,	1
and	1
a	1
gilt-edged	1
period,	1
is	1
not	1
devoid	1
of	1
the	1
essential	1
heat	1
of	1
conflict.	1
Discounting	1
for	1
the	1
gigantic	1
stature	1
and	1
blood-thirstiness	1
of	1
old	1
days,	1
as	1
they	1
have	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
us	1
in	1
fairy-tale	1
and	1
legend,	1
the	1
folk	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
Sagas	1
were	1
Forsytes,	1
assuredly,	1
in	1
their	1
possessive	1
instincts,	1
and	1
as	1
little	1
proof	1
against	1
the	1
inroads	1
of	1
beauty	1
and	1
passion	1
as	1
Swithin,	1
Soames,	1
or	1
even	1
Young	1
Jolyon.	1
And	1
if	1
heroic	1
figures,	1
in	1
days	1
that	1
never	1
were,	1
seem	1
to	1
startle	1
out	1
from	1
their	1
surroundings	1
in	1
fashion	1
unbecoming	1
to	1
a	1
Forsyte	1
of	1
the	1
Victorian	1
era,	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
sure	1
that	1
tribal	1
instinct	1
was	1
even	1
then	1
the	1
prime	1
force,	1
and	1
that	1
“family”	1
and	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
home	1
and	1
property	1
counted	1
as	1
they	1
do	1
to	1
this	1
day,	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
recent	1
efforts	1
to	1
“talk	1
them	1
out.”	1
So	1
many	1
people	1
have	1
written	1
and	1
claimed	1
that	1
their	1
families	1
were	1
the	1
originals	1
of	1
the	1
Forsytes	1
that	1
one	1
has	1
been	1
almost	1
encouraged	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
typicality	1
of	1
an	1
imagined	1
species.	1
Manners	1
change	1
and	1
modes	1
evolve,	1
and	1
“Timothy’s	1
on	1
the	1
Bayswater	1
Road”	1
becomes	1
a	1
nest	1
of	1
the	1
unbelievable	1
in	1
all	1
except	1
essentials;	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
look	1
upon	1
its	1
like	1
again,	1
nor	1
perhaps	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
one	1
as	1
James	1
or	1
Old	1
Jolyon.	1
And	1
yet	1
the	1
figures	1
of	1
Insurance	1
Societies	1
and	1
the	1
utterances	1
of	1
Judges	1
reassure	1
us	1
daily	1
that	1
our	1
earthly	1
paradise	1
is	1
still	1
a	1
rich	1
preserve,	1
where	1
the	1
wild	1
raiders,	1
Beauty	1
and	1
Passion,	1
come	1
stealing	1
in,	1
filching	1
security	1
from	1
beneath	1
our	1
noses.	1
As	1
surely	1
as	1
a	1
dog	1
will	1
bark	1
at	1
a	1
brass	1
band,	1
so	1
will	1
the	1
essential	1
Soames	1
in	1
human	1
nature	1
ever	1
rise	1
up	1
uneasily	1
against	1
the	1
dissolution	1
which	1
hovers	1
round	1
the	1
folds	1
of	1
ownership.	1
“Let	1
the	1
dead	1
Past	1
bury	1
its	1
dead”	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
better	1
saying	1
if	1
the	1
Past	1
ever	1
died.	1
The	1
persistence	1
of	1
the	1
Past	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
tragi-comic	1
blessings	1
which	1
each	1
new	1
age	1
denies,	1
coming	1
cocksure	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
stage	1
to	1
mouth	1
its	1
claim	1
to	1
a	1
perfect	1
novelty.	1
But	1
no	1
Age	1
is	1
so	1
new	1
as	1
that!	1
Human	1
Nature,	1
under	1
its	1
changing	1
pretensions	1
and	1
clothes,	1
is	1
and	1
ever	1
will	1
be	1
very	1
much	1
of	1
a	1
Forsyte,	1
and	1
might,	1
after	1
all,	1
be	1
a	1
much	1
worse	1
animal.	1
Looking	1
back	1
on	1
the	1
Victorian	1
era,	1
whose	1
ripeness,	1
decline,	1
and	1
‘fall-of’	1
is	1
in	1
some	1
sort	1
pictured	1
in	1
“The	1
Forsyte	1
Saga,”	1
we	1
see	1
now	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
but	1
jumped	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
frying-pan	1
into	1
a	1
fire.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
difficult	1
to	1
substantiate	1
a	1
claim	1
that	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
England	1
was	1
better	1
in	1
1913	1
than	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
1886,	1
when	1
the	1
Forsytes	1
assembled	1
at	1
Old	1
Jolyon’s	1
to	1
celebrate	1
the	1
engagement	1
of	1
June	1
to	1
Philip	1
Bosinney.	1
And	1
in	1
1920,	1
when	1
again	1
the	1
clan	1
gathered	1
to	1
bless	1
the	1
marriage	1
of	1
Fleur	1
with	1
Michael	1
Mont,	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
England	1
is	1
as	1
surely	1
too	1
molten	1
and	1
bankrupt	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
eighties	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
congealed	1
and	1
low-percented.	1
If	1
these	1
chronicles	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
really	1
scientific	1
study	1
of	1
transition	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
dwelt	1
probably	1
on	1
such	1
factors	1
as	1
the	1
invention	1
of	1
bicycle,	1
motor-car,	1
and	1
flying-machine;	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
a	1
cheap	1
Press;	1
the	1
decline	1
of	1
country	1
life	1
and	1
increase	1
of	1
the	1
towns;	1
the	1
birth	1
of	1
the	1
Cinema.	1
Men	1
are,	1
in	1
fact,	1
quite	1
unable	1
to	1
control	1
their	1
own	1
inventions;	1
they	1
at	1
best	1
develop	1
adaptability	1
to	1
the	1
new	1
conditions	1
those	1
inventions	1
create.	1
But	1
this	1
long	1
tale	1
is	1
no	1
scientific	1
study	1
of	1
a	1
period;	1
it	1
is	1
rather	1
an	1
intimate	1
incarnation	1
of	1
the	1
disturbance	1
that	1
Beauty	1
effects	1
in	1
the	1
lives	1
of	1
men.	1
The	1
figure	1
of	1
Irene,	1
never,	1
as	1
the	1
reader	1
may	1
possibly	1
have	1
observed,	1
present,	1
except	1
through	1
the	1
senses	1
of	1
other	1
characters,	1
is	1
a	1
concretion	1
of	1
disturbing	1
Beauty	1
impinging	1
on	1
a	1
possessive	1
world.	1
One	1
has	1
noticed	1
that	1
readers,	1
as	1
they	1
wade	1
on	1
through	1
the	1
salt	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
Saga,	1
are	1
inclined	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
to	1
pity	1
Soames,	1
and	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
in	1
doing	1
so	1
they	1
are	1
in	1
revolt	1
against	1
the	1
mood	1
of	1
his	1
creator.	1
Far	1
from	1
it!	1
He,	1
too,	1
pities	1
Soames,	1
the	1
tragedy	1
of	1
whose	1
life	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
simple,	1
uncontrollable	1
tragedy	1
of	1
being	1
unlovable,	1
without	1
quite	1
a	1
thick	1
enough	1
skin	1
to	1
be	1
thoroughly	1
unconscious	1
of	1
the	1
fact.	1
Not	1
even	1
Fleur	1
loves	1
Soames	1
as	1
he	1
feels	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
loved.	1
But	1
in	1
pitying	1
Soames,	1
readers	1
incline,	1
perhaps,	1
to	1
animus	1
against	1
Irene:	1
After	1
all,	1
they	1
think,	1
he	1
wasn’t	1
a	1
bad	1
fellow,	1
it	1
wasn’t	1
his	1
fault;	1
she	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
forgiven	1
him,	1
and	1
so	1
on!	1
And,	1
taking	1
sides,	1
they	1
lose	1
perception	1
of	1
the	1
simple	1
truth,	1
which	1
underlies	1
the	1
whole	1
story,	1
that	1
where	1
sex	1
attraction	1
is	1
utterly	1
and	1
definitely	1
lacking	1
in	1
one	1
partner	1
to	1
a	1
union,	1
no	1
amount	1
of	1
pity,	1
or	1
reason,	1
or	1
duty,	1
or	1
what	1
not,	1
can	1
overcome	1
a	1
repulsion	1
implicit	1
in	1
Nature.	1
Whether	1
it	1
ought	1
to,	1
or	1
no,	1
is	1
beside	1
the	1
point;	1
because	1
in	1
fact	1
it	1
never	1
does.	1
And	1
where	1
Irene	1
seems	1
hard	1
and	1
cruel,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
Bois	1
de	1
Boulogne,	1
or	1
the	1
Goupenor	1
Gallery,	1
she	1
is	1
but	1
wisely	1
realistic	1
—	1
knowing	1
that	1
the	1
least	1
concession	1
is	1
the	1
inch	1
which	1
precedes	1
the	1
impossible,	1
the	1
repulsive	1
ell.	1
A	1
criticism	1
one	1
might	1
pass	1
on	1
the	1
last	1
phase	1
of	1
the	1
Saga	1
is	1
the	1
complaint	1
that	1
Irene	1
and	1
Jolyon	1
those	1
rebels	1
against	1
property	1
—	1
claim	1
spiritual	1
property	1
in	1
their	1
son	1
Jon.	1
But	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
hypercriticism,	1
as	1
the	1
tale	1
is	1
told.	1
No	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
could	1
have	1
let	1
the	1
boy	1
marry	1
Fleur	1
without	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
facts;	1
and	1
the	1
facts	1
determine	1
Jon,	1
not	1
the	1
persuasion	1
of	1
his	1
parents.	1
Moreover,	1
Jolyon’s	1
persuasion	1
is	1
not	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
account,	1
but	1
on	1
Irene’s,	1
and	1
Irene’s	1
persuasion	1
becomes	1
a	1
reiterated:	1
“Don’t	1
think	1
of	1
me,	1
think	1
of	1
yourself!”	1
That	1
Jon,	1
knowing	1
the	1
facts,	1
can	1
realise	1
his	1
mother’s	1
feelings,	1
will	1
hardly	1
with	1
justice	1
be	1
held	1
proof	1
that	1
she	1
is,	1
after	1
all,	1
a	1
Forsyte.	1
But	1
though	1
the	1
impingement	1
of	1
Beauty	1
and	1
the	1
claims	1
of	1
Freedom	1
on	1
a	1
possessive	1
world	1
are	1
the	1
main	1
prepossessions	1
of	1
the	1
Forsyte	1
Saga,	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
absolved	1
from	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
embalming	1
the	1
upper-middle	1
class.	1
As	1
the	1
old	1
Egyptians	1
placed	1
around	1
their	1
mummies	1
the	1
necessaries	1
of	1
a	1
future	1
existence,	1
so	1
I	1
have	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
lay	1
beside	1
the,	1
figures	1
of	1
Aunts	1
Ann	1
and	1
Juley	1
and	1
Hester,	1
of	1
Timothy	1
and	1
Swithin,	1
of	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
and	1
James,	1
and	1
of	1
their	1
sons,	1
that	1
which	1
shall	1
guarantee	1
them	1
a	1
little	1
life	1
here-after,	1
a	1
little	1
balm	1
in	1
the	1
hurried	1
Gilead	1
of	1
a	1
dissolving	1
“Progress.”	1
If	1
the	1
upper-middle	1
class,	1
with	1
other	1
classes,	1
is	1
destined	1
to	1
“move	1
on”	1
into	1
amorphism,	1
here,	1
pickled	1
in	1
these	1
pages,	1
it	1
lies	1
under	1
glass	1
for	1
strollers	1
in	1
the	1
wide	1
and	1
ill-arranged	1
museum	1
of	1
Letters.	1
Here	1
it	1
rests,	1
preserved	1
in	1
its	1
own	1
juice:	1
The	1
Sense	1
of	1
Property.	1

Chapter	1
1	1
‘At	1
Home’	1
at	1
Old	1
Jolyon’s	1
Those	1
privileged	1
to	1
be	1
present	1
at	1
a	1
family	1
festival	1
of	1
the	1
Forsytes	1
have	1
seen	1
that	1
charming	1
and	1
instructive	1
sight	1
—	1
an	1
upper	1
middle-class	1
family	1
in	1
full	1
plumage.	1
But	1
whosoever	1
of	1
these	1
favoured	1
persons	1
has	1
possessed	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
psychological	1
analysis	1
(a	1
talent	1
without	1
monetary	1
value	1
and	1
properly	1
ignored	1
by	1
the	1
Forsytes),	1
has	1
witnessed	1
a	1
spectacle,	1
not	1
only	1
delightful	1
in	1
itself,	1
but	1
illustrative	1
of	1
an	1
obscure	1
human	1
problem.	1
In	1
plainer	1
words,	1
he	1
has	1
gleaned	1
from	1
a	1
gathering	1
of	1
this	1
family	1
—	1
no	1
branch	1
of	1
which	1
had	1
a	1
liking	1
for	1
the	1
other,	1
between	1
no	1
three	1
members	1
of	1
whom	1
existed	1
anything	1
worthy	1
of	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
sympathy	1
—	1
evidence	1
of	1
that	1
mysterious	1
concrete	1
tenacity	1
which	1
renders	1
a	1
family	1
so	1
formidable	1
a	1
unit	1
of	1
society,	1
so	1
clear	1
a	1
reproduction	1
of	1
society	1
in	1
miniature.	1
He	1
has	1
been	1
admitted	1
to	1
a	1
vision	1
of	1
the	1
dim	1
roads	1
of	1
social	1
progress,	1
has	1
understood	1
something	1
of	1
patriarchal	1
life,	1
of	1
the	1
swarmings	1
of	1
savage	1
hordes,	1
of	1
the	1
rise	1
and	1
fall	1
of	1
nations.	1
He	1
is	1
like	1
one	1
who,	1
having	1
watched	1
a	1
tree	1
grow	1
from	1
its	1
planting	1
—	1
a	1
paragon	1
of	1
tenacity,	1
insulation,	1
and	1
success,	1
amidst	1
the	1
deaths	1
of	1
a	1
hundred	1
other	1
plants	1
less	1
fibrous,	1
sappy,	1
and	1
persistent	1
—	1
one	1
day	1
will	1
see	1
it	1
flourishing	1
with	1
bland,	1
full	1
foliage,	1
in	1
an	1
almost	1
repugnant	1
prosperity,	1
at	1
the	1
summit	1
of	1
its	1
efflorescence.	1
On	1
June	1
15,	1
eighteen	1
eighty-six,	1
about	1
four	1
of	1
the	1
afternoon,	1
the	1
observer	1
who	1
chanced	1
to	1
be	1
present	1
at	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
Forsyte	1
in	1
Stanhope	1
Gate,	1
might	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
highest	1
efflorescence	1
of	1
the	1
Forsytes.	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
occasion	1
of	1
an	1
‘at	1
home’	1
to	1
celebrate	1
the	1
engagement	1
of	1
Miss	1
June	1
Forsyte,	1
old	1
Jolyon’s	1
granddaughter,	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Philip	1
Bosinney.	1
In	1
the	1
bravery	1
of	1
light	1
gloves,	1
buff	1
waistcoats,	1
feathers	1
and	1
frocks,	1
the	1
family	1
were	1
present,	1
even	1
Aunt	1
Ann,	1
who	1
now	1
but	1
seldom	1
left	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
her	1
brother	1
Timothy’s	1
green	1
drawing-room,	1
where,	1
under	1
the	1
aegis	1
of	1
a	1
plume	1
of	1
dyed	1
pampas	1
grass	1
in	1
a	1
light	1
blue	1
vase,	1
she	1
sat	1
all	1
day	1
reading	1
and	1
knitting,	1
surrounded	1
by	1
the	1
effigies	1
of	1
three	1
generations	1
of	1
Forsytes.	1
Even	1
Aunt	1
Ann	1
was	1
there;	1
her	1
inflexible	1
back,	1
and	1
the	1
dignity	1
of	1
her	1
calm	1
old	1
face	1
personifying	1
the	1
rigid	1
possessiveness	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
idea.	1
When	1
a	1
Forsyte	1
was	1
engaged,	1
married,	1
or	1
born,	1
the	1
Forsytes	1
were	1
present;	1
when	1
a	1
Forsyte	1
died	1
—	1
but	1
no	1
Forsyte	1
had	1
as	1
yet	1
died;	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
die;	1
death	1
being	1
contrary	1
to	1
their	1
principles,	1
they	1
took	1
precautions	1
against	1
it,	1
the	1
instinctive	1
precautions	1
of	1
highly	1
vitalized	1
persons	1
who	1
resent	1
encroachments	1
on	1
their	1
property.	1
About	1
the	1
Forsytes	1
mingling	1
that	1
day	1
with	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
other	1
guests,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
more	1
than	1
ordinarily	1
groomed	1
look,	1
an	1
alert,	1
inquisitive	1
assurance,	1
a	1
brilliant	1
respectability,	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
were	1
attired	1
in	1
defiance	1
of	1
something.	1
The	1
habitual	1
sniff	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
Soames	1
Forsyte	1
had	1
spread	1
through	1
their	1
ranks;	1
they	1
were	1
on	1
their	1
guard.	1
The	1
subconscious	1
offensiveness	1
of	1
their	1
attitude	1
has	1
constituted	1
old	1
Jolyon’s	1
‘home’	1
the	1
psychological	1
moment	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
history,	1
made	1
it	1
the	1
prelude	1
of	1
their	1
drama.	1
The	1
Forsytes	1
were	1
resentful	1
of	1
something,	1
not	1
individually,	1
but	1
as	1
a	1
family;	1
this	1
resentment	1
expressed	1
itself	1
in	1
an	1
added	1
perfection	1
of	1
raiment,	1
an	1
exuberance	1
of	1
family	1
cordiality,	1
an	1
exaggeration	1
of	1
family	1
importance,	1
and	1
—	1
the	1
sniff.	1
Danger	1
—	1
so	1
indispensable	1
in	1
bringing	1
out	1
the	1
fundamental	1
quality	1
of	1
any	1
society,	1
group,	1
or	1
individual	1
—	1
was	1
what	1
the	1
Forsytes	1
scented;	1
the	1
premonition	1
of	1
danger	1
put	1
a	1
burnish	1
on	1
their	1
armour.	1
For	1
the	1
first	1
time,	1
as	1
a	1
family,	1
they	1
appeared	1
to	1
have	1
an	1
instinct	1
of	1
being	1
in	1
contact,	1
with	1
some	1
strange	1
and	1
unsafe	1
thing.	1
Over	1
against	1
the	1
piano	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
bulk	1
and	1
stature	1
was	1
wearing	1
two	1
waistcoats	1
on	1
his	1
wide	1
chest,	1
two	1
waistcoats	1
and	1
a	1
ruby	1
pin,	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
single	1
satin	1
waistcoat	1
and	1
diamond	1
pin	1
of	1
more	1
usual	1
occasions,	1
and	1
his	1
shaven,	1
square,	1
old	1
face,	1
the	1
colour	1
of	1
pale	1
leather,	1
with	1
pale	1
eyes,	1
had	1
its	1
most	1
dignified	1
look,	1
above	1
his	1
satin	1
stock.	1
This	1
was	1
Swithin	1
Forsyte.	1
Close	1
to	1
the	1
window,	1
where	1
he	1
could	1
get	1
more	1
than	1
his	1
fair	1
share	1
of	1
fresh	1
air,	1
the	1
other	1
twin,	1
James	1
—	1
the	1
fat	1
and	1
the	1
lean	1
of	1
it,	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
called	1
these	1
brothers	1
—	1
like	1
the	1
bulky	1
Swithin,	1
over	1
six	1
feet	1
in	1
height,	1
but	1
very	1
lean,	1
as	1
though	1
destined	1
from	1
his	1
birth	1
to	1
strike	1
a	1
balance	1
and	1
maintain	1
an	1
average,	1
brooded	1
over	1
the	1
scene	1
with	1
his	1
permanent	1
stoop;	1
his	1
grey	1
eyes	1
had	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
fixed	1
absorption	1
in	1
some	1
secret	1
worry,	1
broken	1
at	1
intervals	1
by	1
a	1
rapid,	1
shifting	1
scrutiny	1
of	1
surrounding	1
facts;	1
his	1
cheeks,	1
thinned	1
by	1
two	1
parallel	1
folds,	1
and	1
a	1
long,	1
clean-shaven	1
upper	1
lip,	1
were	1
framed	1
within	1
Dundreary	1
whiskers.	1
In	1
his	1
hands	1
he	1
turned	1
and	1
turned	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
china.	1
Not	1
far	1
off,	1
listening	1
to	1
a	1
lady	1
in	1
brown,	1
his	1
only	1
son	1
Soames,	1
pale	1
and	1
well-shaved,	1
dark-haired,	1
rather	1
bald,	1
had	1
poked	1
his	1
chin	1
up	1
sideways,	1
carrying	1
his	1
nose	1
with	1
that	1
aforesaid	1
appearance	1
of	1
‘sniff,’	1
as	1
though	1
despising	1
an	1
egg	1
which	1
he	1
knew	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
digest.	1
Behind	1
him	1
his	1
cousin,	1
the	1
tall	1
George,	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
fifth	1
Forsyte,	1
Roger,	1
had	1
a	1
Quilpish	1
look	1
on	1
his	1
fleshy	1
face,	1
pondering	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
sardonic	1
jests.	1
Something	1
inherent	1
to	1
the	1
occasion	1
had	1
affected	1
them	1
all.	1
Seated	1
in	1
a	1
row	1
close	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
were	1
three	1
ladies	1
—	1
Aunts	1
Ann,	1
Hester	1
(the	1
two	1
Forsyte	1
maids),	1
and	1
Juley	1
(short	1
for	1
Julia),	1
who	1
not	1
in	1
first	1
youth	1
had	1
so	1
far	1
forgotten	1
herself	1
as	1
to	1
marry	1
Septimus	1
Small,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
poor	1
constitution.	1
She	1
had	1
survived	1
him	1
for	1
many	1
years.	1
With	1
her	1
elder	1
and	1
younger	1
sister	1
she	1
lived	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Timothy,	1
her	1
sixth	1
and	1
youngest	1
brother,	1
on	1
the	1
Bayswater	1
Road.	1
Each	1
of	1
these	1
ladies	1
held	1
fans	1
in	1
their	1
hands,	1
and	1
each	1
with	1
some	1
touch	1
of	1
colour,	1
some	1
emphatic	1
feather	1
or	1
brooch,	1
testified	1
to	1
the	1
solemnity	1
of	1
the	1
opportunity.	1
In	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
under	1
the	1
chandelier,	1
as	1
became	1
a	1
host,	1
stood	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
family,	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
himself.	1
Eighty	1
years	1
of	1
age,	1
with	1
his	1
fine,	1
white	1
hair,	1
his	1
dome-like	1
forehead,	1
his	1
little,	1
dark	1
grey	1
eyes,	1
and	1
an	1
immense	1
white	1
moustache,	1
which	1
drooped	1
and	1
spread	1
below	1
the	1
level	1
of	1
his	1
strong	1
jaw,	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
patriarchal	1
look,	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
lean	1
cheeks	1
and	1
hollows	1
at	1
his	1
temples,	1
seemed	1
master	1
of	1
perennial	1
youth.	1
He	1
held	1
himself	1
extremely	1
upright,	1
and	1
his	1
shrewd,	1
steady	1
eyes	1
had	1
lost	1
none	1
of	1
their	1
clear	1
shining.	1
Thus	1
he	1
gave	1
an	1
impression	1
of	1
superiority	1
to	1
the	1
doubts	1
and	1
dislikes	1
of	1
smaller	1
men.	1
Having	1
had	1
his	1
own	1
way	1
for	1
innumerable	1
years,	1
he	1
had	1
earned	1
a	1
prescriptive	1
right	1
to	1
it.	1
It	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
occurred	1
to	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
wear	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
doubt	1
or	1
of	1
defiance.	1
Between	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
four	1
other	1
brothers	1
who	1
were	1
present,	1
James,	1
Swithin,	1
Nicholas,	1
and	1
Roger,	1
there	1
was	1
much	1
difference,	1
much	1
similarity.	1
In	1
turn,	1
each	1
of	1
these	1
four	1
brothers	1
was	1
very	1
different	1
from	1
the	1
other,	1
yet	1
they,	1
too,	1
were	1
alike.	1
Through	1
the	1
varying	1
features	1
and	1
expression	1
of	1
those	1
five	1
faces	1
could	1
be	1
marked	1
a	1
certain	1
steadfastness	1
of	1
chin,	1
underlying	1
surface	1
distinctions,	1
marking	1
a	1
racial	1
stamp,	1
too	1
prehistoric	1
to	1
trace,	1
too	1
remote	1
and	1
permanent	1
to	1
discuss	1
—	1
the	1
very	1
hall-mark	1
and	1
guarantee	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
fortunes.	1
Among	1
the	1
younger	1
generation,	1
in	1
the	1
tall,	1
bull-like	1
George,	1
in	1
pallid	1
strenuous	1
Archibald,	1
in	1
young	1
Nicholas	1
with	1
his	1
sweet	1
and	1
tentative	1
obstinacy,	1
in	1
the	1
grave	1
and	1
foppishly	1
determined	1
Eustace,	1
there	1
was	1
this	1
same	1
stamp	1
—	1
less	1
meaningful	1
perhaps,	1
but	1
unmistakable	1
—	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
something	1
ineradicable	1
in	1
the	1
family	1
soul.	1
At	1
one	1
time	1
or	1
another	1
during	1
the	1
afternoon,	1
all	1
these	1
faces,	1
so	1
dissimilar	1
and	1
so	1
alike,	1
had	1
worn	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
distrust,	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
undoubtedly	1
the	1
man	1
whose	1
acquaintance	1
they	1
were	1
thus	1
assembled	1
to	1
make.	1
Philip	1
Bosinney	1
was	1
known	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
without	1
fortune,	1
but	1
Forsyte	1
girls	1
had	1
become	1
engaged	1
to	1
such	1
before,	1
and	1
had	1
actually	1
married	1
them.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
altogether	1
for	1
this	1
reason,	1
therefore,	1
that	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
the	1
Forsytes	1
misgave	1
them.	1
They	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
explained	1
the	1
origin	1
of	1
a	1
misgiving	1
obscured	1
by	1
the	1
mist	1
of	1
family	1
gossip.	1
A	1
story	1
was	1
undoubtedly	1
told	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
paid	1
his	1
duty	1
call	1
to	1
Aunts	1
Ann,	1
Juley,	1
and	1
Hester,	1
in	1
a	1
soft	1
grey	1
hat	1
—	1
a	1
soft	1
grey	1
hat,	1
not	1
even	1
a	1
new	1
one	1
—	1
a	1
dusty	1
thing	1
with	1
a	1
shapeless	1
crown.	1
“So,	1
extraordinary,	1
my	1
dear	1
—	1
so	1
odd,”	1
Aunt	1
Hester,	1
passing	1
through	1
the	1
little,	1
dark	1
hall	1
(she	1
was	1
rather	1
short-sighted),	1
had	1
tried	1
to	1
‘shoo’	1
it	1
off	1
a	1
chair,	1
taking	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
strange,	1
disreputable	1
cat	1
—	1
Tommy	1
had	1
such	1
disgraceful	1
friends!	1
She	1
was	1
disturbed	1
when	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
move.	1
Like	1
an	1
artist	1
for	1
ever	1
seeking	1
to	1
discover	1
the	1
significant	1
trifle	1
which	1
embodies	1
the	1
whole	1
character	1
of	1
a	1
scene,	1
or	1
place,	1
or	1
person,	1
so	1
those	1
unconscious	1
artists	1
—	1
the	1
Forsytes	1
had	1
fastened	1
by	1
intuition	1
on	1
this	1
hat;	1
it	1
was	1
their	1
significant	1
trifle,	1
the	1
detail	1
in	1
which	1
was	1
embedded	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
matter;	1
for	1
each	1
had	1
asked	1
himself:	1
“Come,	1
now,	1
should	1
I	1
have	1
paid	1
that	1
visit	1
in	1
that	1
hat?”	1
and	1
each	1
had	1
answered	1
“No!”	1
and	1
some,	1
with	1
more	1
imagination	1
than	1
others,	1
had	1
added:	1
“It	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
come	1
into	1
my	1
head!”	1
George,	1
on	1
hearing	1
the	1
story,	1
grinned.	1
The	1
hat	1
had	1
obviously	1
been	1
worn	1
as	1
a	1
practical	1
joke!	1
He	1
himself	1
was	1
a	1
connoisseur	1
of	1
such.	1
“Very	1
haughty!”	1
he	1
said,	1
“the	1
wild	1
Buccaneer.”	1
And	1
this	1
mot,	1
the	1
‘Buccaneer,’	1
was	1
bandied	1
from	1
mouth	1
to	1
mouth,	1
till	1
it	1
became	1
the	1
favourite	1
mode	1
of	1
alluding	1
to	1
Bosinney.	1
Her	1
aunts	1
reproached	1
June	1
afterwards	1
about	1
the	1
hat.	1
“We	1
don’t	1
think	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
let	1
him,	1
dear!”	1
they	1
had	1
said.	1
June	1
had	1
answered	1
in	1
her	1
imperious	1
brisk	1
way,	1
like	1
the	1
little	1
embodiment	1
of	1
will	1
she	1
was:	1
“Oh!	1
what	1
does	1
it	1
matter?	1
Phil	1
never	1
knows	1
what	1
he’s	1
got	1
on!”	1
No	1
one	1
had	1
credited	1
an	1
answer	1
so	1
outrageous.	1
A	1
man	1
not	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
on?	1
No,	1
no!	1
What	1
indeed	1
was	1
this	1
young	1
man,	1
who,	1
in	1
becoming	1
engaged	1
to	1
June,	1
old	1
Jolyon’s	1
acknowledged	1
heiress,	1
had	1
done	1
so	1
well	1
for	1
himself?	1
He	1
was	1
an	1
architect,	1
not	1
in	1
itself	1
a	1
sufficient	1
reason	1
for	1
wearing	1
such	1
a	1
hat.	1
None	1
of	1
the	1
Forsytes	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
architects,	1
but	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
knew	1
two	1
architects	1
who	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
worn	1
such	1
a	1
hat	1
upon	1
a	1
call	1
of	1
ceremony	1
in	1
the	1
London	1
season.	1
Dangerous	1
—	1
ah,	1
dangerous!	1
June,	1
of	1
course,	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
this,	1
but,	1
though	1
not	1
yet	1
nineteen,	1
she	1
was	1
notorious.	1
Had	1
she	1
not	1
said	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Soames	1
—	1
who	1
was	1
always	1
so	1
beautifully	1
dressed	1
—	1
that	1
feathers	1
were	1
vulgar?	1
Mrs.	1
Soames	1
had	1
actually	1
given	1
up	1
wearing	1
feathers,	1
so	1
dreadfully	1
downright	1
was	1
dear	1
June!	1
These	1
misgivings,	1
this	1
disapproval,	1
and	1
perfectly	1
genuine	1
distrust,	1
did	1
not	1
prevent	1
the	1
Forsytes	1
from	1
gathering	1
to	1
old	1
Jolyon’s	1
invitation.	1
An	1
‘At	1
Home’	1
at	1
Stanhope	1
Gate	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
rarity;	1
none	1
had	1
been	1
held	1
for	1
twelve	1
years,	1
not	1
indeed,	1
since	1
old	1
Mrs.	1
Jolyon	1
had	1
died.	1
Never	1
had	1
there	1
been	1
so	1
full	1
an	1
assembly,	1
for,	1
mysteriously	1
united	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
differences,	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
arms	1
against	1
a	1
common	1
peril.	1
Like	1
cattle	1
when	1
a	1
dog	1
comes	1
into	1
the	1
field,	1
they	1
stood	1
head	1
to	1
head	1
and	1
shoulder	1
to	1
shoulder,	1
prepared	1
to	1
run	1
upon	1
and	1
trample	1
the	1
invader	1
to	1
death.	1
They	1
had	1
come,	1
too,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
to	1
get	1
some	1
notion	1
of	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
presents	1
they	1
would	1
ultimately	1
be	1
expected	1
to	1
give;	1
for	1
though	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
wedding	1
gifts	1
was	1
usually	1
graduated	1
in	1
this	1
way:	1
‘What	1
are	1
you	1
givin’?	1
Nicholas	1
is	1
givin’	1
spoons!’—	1
so	1
very	1
much	1
depended	1
on	1
the	1
bridegroom.	1
If	1
he	1
were	1
sleek,	1
well-brushed,	1
prosperous-looking,	1
it	1
was	1
more	1
necessary	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
nice	1
things;	1
he	1
would	1
expect	1
them.	1
In	1
the	1
end	1
each	1
gave	1
exactly	1
what	1
was	1
right	1
and	1
proper,	1
by	1
a	1
species	1
of	1
family	1
adjustment	1
arrived	1
at	1
as	1
prices	1
are	1
arrived	1
at	1
on	1
the	1
Stock	1
Exchange	1
—	1
the	1
exact	1
niceties	1
being	1
regulated	1
at	1
Timothy’s	1
commodious,	1
red-brick	1
residence	1
in	1
Bayswater,	1
overlooking	1
the	1
Park,	1
where	1
dwelt	1
Aunts	1
Ann,	1
Juley,	1
and	1
Hester.	1
The	1
uneasiness	1
of	1
the	1
Forsyte	1
family	1
has	1
been	1
justified	1
by	1
the	1
simple	1
mention	1
of	1
the	1
hat.	1
How	1
impossible	1
and	1
wrong	1
would	1
it	1
have	1
been	1
for	1
any	1
family,	1
with	1
the	1
regard	1
for	1
appearances	1
which	1
should	1
ever	1
characterize	1
the	1
great	1
upper	1
middle-class,	1
to	1
feel	1
otherwise	1
than	1
uneasy!	1
The	1
author	1
of	1
the	1
uneasiness	1
stood	1
talking	1
to	1
June	1
by	1
the	1
further	1
door;	1
his	1
curly	1
hair	1
had	1
a	1
rumpled	1
appearance,	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
found	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
around	1
him	1
unusual.	1
He	1
had	1
an	1
air,	1
too,	1
of	1
having	1
a	1
joke	1
all	1
to	1
himself.	1
George,	1
speaking	1
aside	1
to	1
his	1
brother,	1
Eustace,	1
said:	1
“Looks	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
might	1
make	1
a	1
bolt	1
of	1
it	1
—	1
the	1
dashing	1
Buccaneer!”	1
This	1
‘very	1
singular-looking	1
man,’	1
as	1
Mrs.	1
Small	1
afterwards	1
called	1
him,	1
was	1
of	1
medium	1
height	1
and	1
strong	1
build,	1
with	1
a	1
pale,	1
brown	1
face,	1
a	1
dust-coloured	1
moustache,	1
very	1
prominent	1
cheek-bones,	1
and	1
hollow	1
checks.	1
His	1
forehead	1
sloped	1
back	1
towards	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
bulged	1
out	1
in	1
bumps	1
over	1
the	1
eyes,	1
like	1
foreheads	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
Lion-house	1
at	1
the	1
Zoo.	1
He	1
had	1
sherry-coloured	1
eyes,	1
disconcertingly	1
inattentive	1
at	1
times.	1
Old	1
Jolyon’s	1
coachman,	1
after	1
driving	1
June	1
and	1
Bosinney	1
to	1
the	1
theatre,	1
had	1
remarked	1
to	1
the	1
butler:	1
“I	1
dunno	1
what	1
to	1
make	1
of	1
’im.	1
Looks	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
like	1
an	1
‘alf-tame	1
leopard.”	1
And	1
every	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
a	1
Forsyte	1
would	1
come	1
up,	1
sidle	1
round,	1
and	1
take	1
a	1
look	1
at	1
him.	1
June	1
stood	1
in	1
front,	1
fending	1
off	1
this	1
idle	1
curiosity	1
—	1
a	1
little	1
bit	1
of	1
a	1
thing,	1
as	1
somebody	1
once	1
said,	1
‘all	1
hair	1
and	1
spirit,’	1
with	1
fearless	1
blue	1
eyes,	1
a	1
firm	1
jaw,	1
and	1
a	1
bright	1
colour,	1
whose	1
face	1
and	1
body	1
seemed	1
too	1
slender	1
for	1
her	1
crown	1
of	1
red-gold	1
hair.	1
A	1
tall	1
woman,	1
with	1
a	1
beautiful	1
figure,	1
which	1
some	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
had	1
once	1
compared	1
to	1
a	1
heathen	1
goddess,	1
stood	1
looking	1
at	1
these	1
two	1
with	1
a	1
shadowy	1
smile.	1
Her	1
hands,	1
gloved	1
in	1
French	1
grey,	1
were	1
crossed	1
one	1
over	1
the	1
other,	1
her	1
grave,	1
charming	1
face	1
held	1
to	1
one	1
side,	1
and	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
all	1
men	1
near	1
were	1
fastened	1
on	1
it.	1
Her	1
figure	1
swayed,	1
so	1
balanced	1
that	1
the	1
very	1
air	1
seemed	1
to	1
set	1
it	1
moving.	1
There	1
was	1
warmth,	1
but	1
little	1
colour,	1
in	1
her	1
cheeks;	1
her	1
large,	1
dark	1
eyes	1
were	1
soft.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
her	1
lips	1
—	1
asking	1
a	1
question,	1
giving	1
an	1
answer,	1
with	1
that	1
shadowy	1
smile	1
—	1
that	1
men	1
looked;	1
they	1
were	1
sensitive	1
lips,	1
sensuous	1
and	1
sweet,	1
and	1
through	1
them	1
seemed	1
to	1
come	1
warmth	1
and	1
perfume	1
like	1
the	1
warmth	1
and	1
perfume	1
of	1
a	1
flower.	1
The	1
engaged	1
couple	1
thus	1
scrutinized	1
were	1
unconscious	1
of	1
this	1
passive	1
goddess.	1
It	1
was	1
Bosinney	1
who	1
first	1
noticed	1
her,	1
and	1
asked	1
her	1
name.	1
June	1
took	1
her	1
lover	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
woman	1
with	1
the	1
beautiful	1
figure.	1
“Irene	1
is	1
my	1
greatest	1
chum,”	1
she	1
said:	1
“Please	1
be	1
good	1
friends,	1
you	1
two!”	1
At	1
the	1
little	1
lady’s	1
command	1
they	1
all	1
three	1
smiled;	1
and	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
smiling,	1
Soames	1
Forsyte,	1
silently	1
appearing	1
from	1
behind	1
the	1
woman	1
with	1
the	1
beautiful	1
figure,	1
who	1
was	1
his	1
wife,	1
said:	1
“Ah!	1
introduce	1
me	1
too!”	1
He	1
was	1
seldom,	1
indeed,	1
far	1
from	1
Irene’s	1
side	1
at	1
public	1
functions,	1
and	1
even	1
when	1
separated	1
by	1
the	1
exigencies	1
of	1
social	1
intercourse,	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
following	1
her	1
about	1
with	1
his	1
eyes,	1
in	1
which	1
were	1
strange	1
expressions	1
of	1
watchfulness	1
and	1
longing.	1
At	1
the	1
window	1
his	1
father,	1
James,	1
was	1
still	1
scrutinizing	1
the	1
marks	1
on	1
the	1
piece	1
of	1
china.	1
“I	1
wonder	1
at	1
Jolyon’s	1
allowing	1
this	1
engagement,”	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Aunt	1
Ann.	1
“They	1
tell	1
me	1
there’s	1
no	1
chance	1
of	1
their	1
getting	1
married	1
for	1
years.	1
This	1
young	1
Bosinney”	1
(he	1
made	1
the	1
word	1
a	1
dactyl	1
in	1
opposition	1
to	1
general	1
usage	1
of	1
a	1
short	1
o)	1
“has	1
got	1
nothing.	1
When	1
Winifred	1
married	1
Dartie,	1
I	1
made	1
him	1
bring	1
every	1
penny	1
into	1
settlement	1
—	1
lucky	1
thing,	1
too	1
—	1
they’d	1
ha’	1
had	1
nothing	1
by	1
this	1
time!”	1
Aunt	1
Ann	1
looked	1
up	1
from	1
her	1
velvet	1
chair.	1
Grey	1
curls	1
banded	1
her	1
forehead,	1
curls	1
that,	1
unchanged	1
for	1
decades,	1
had	1
extinguished	1
in	1
the	1
family	1
all	1
sense	1
of	1
time.	1
She	1
made	1
no	1
reply,	1
for	1
she	1
rarely	1
spoke,	1
husbanding	1
her	1
aged	1
voice;	1
but	1
to	1
James,	1
uneasy	1
of	1
conscience,	1
her	1
look	1
was	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
an	1
answer.	1
“Well,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“I	1
couldn’t	1
help	1
Irene’s	1
having	1
no	1
money.	1
Soames	1
was	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
hurry;	1
he	1
got	1
quite	1
thin	1
dancing	1
attendance	1
on	1
her.”	1
Putting	1
the	1
bowl	1
pettishly	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
piano,	1
he	1
let	1
his	1
eyes	1
wander	1
to	1
the	1
group	1
by	1
the	1
door.	1
“It’s	1
my	1
opinion,”	1
he	1
said	1
unexpectedly,	1
“that	1
it’s	1
just	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
it	1
is.”	1
Aunt	1
Ann	1
did	1
not	1
ask	1
him	1
to	1
explain	1
this	1
strange	1
utterance.	1
She	1
knew	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
thinking.	1
If	1
Irene	1
had	1
no	1
money	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
foolish	1
as	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
wrong;	1
for	1
they	1
said	1
—	1
they	1
said	1
—	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
asking	1
for	1
a	1
separate	1
room;	1
but,	1
of	1
course,	1
Soames	1
had	1
not.	1
.	3
James	1
interrupted	1
her	1
reverie:	1
“But	1
where,”	1
he	1
asked,	1
“was	1
Timothy?	1
Hadn’t	1
he	1
come	1
with	1
them?”	1
Through	1
Aunt	1
Ann’s	1
compressed	1
lips	1
a	1
tender	1
smile	1
forced	1
its	1
way:	1
“No,	1
he	1
didn’t	1
think	1
it	1
wise,	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
this	1
diphtheria	1
about;	1
and	1
he	1
so	1
liable	1
to	1
take	1
things.”	1
James	1
answered:	1
“Well,	1
HE	1
takes	1
good	1
care	1
of	1
himself.	1
I	1
can’t	1
afford	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
myself	1
that	1
he	1
does.”	1
Nor	1
was	1
it	1
easy	1
to	1
say	1
which,	1
of	1
admiration,	1
envy,	1
or	1
contempt,	1
was	1
dominant	1
in	1
that	1
remark.	1
Timothy,	1
indeed,	1
was	1
seldom	1
seen.	1
The	1
baby	1
of	1
the	1
family,	1
a	1
publisher	1
by	1
profession,	1
he	1
had	1
some	1
years	1
before,	1
when	1
business	1
was	1
at	1
full	1
tide,	1
scented	1
out	1
the	1
stagnation	1
which,	1
indeed,	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
come,	1
but	1
which	1
ultimately,	1
as	1
all	1
agreed,	1
was	1
bound	1
to	1
set	1
in,	1
and,	1
selling	1
his	1
share	1
in	1
a	1
firm	1
engaged	1
mainly	1
in	1
the	1
production	1
of	1
religious	1
books,	1
had	1
invested	1
the	1
quite	1
conspicuous	1
proceeds	1
in	1
three	1
per	1
cent.	1
consols.	1
By	1
this	1
act	1
he	1
had	1
at	1
once	1
assumed	1
an	1
isolated	1
position,	1
no	1
other	1
Forsyte	1
being	1
content	1
with	1
less	1
than	1
four	1
per	1
cent.	1
for	1
his	1
money;	1
and	1
this	1
isolation	1
had	1
slowly	1
and	1
surely	1
undermined	1
a	1
spirit	1
perhaps	1
better	1
than	1
commonly	1
endowed	1
with	1
caution.	1
He	1
had	1
become	1
almost	1
a	1
myth	1
—	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
incarnation	1
of	1
security	1
haunting	1
the	1
background	1
of	1
the	1
Forsyte	1
universe.	1
He	1
had	1
never	1
committed	1
the	1
imprudence	1
of	1
marrying,	1
or	1
encumbering	1
himself	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
with	1
children.	1
James	1
resumed,	1
tapping	1
the	1
piece	1
of	1
china:	1
“This	1
isn’t	1
real	1
old	1
Worcester.	1
I	1
s’pose	1
Jolyon’s	1
told	1
you	1
something	1
about	1
the	1
young	1
man.	1
From	1
all	1
I	1
can	1
learn,	1
he’s	1
got	1
no	1
business,	1
no	1
income,	1
and	1
no	1
connection	1
worth	1
speaking	1
of;	1
but	1
then,	1
I	1
know	1
nothing	1
—	1
nobody	1
tells	1
me	1
anything.”	1
Aunt	1
Ann	1
shook	1
her	1
head.	1
Over	1
her	1
square-chinned,	1
aquiline	1
old	1
face	1
a	1
trembling	1
passed;	1
the	1
spidery	1
fingers	1
of	1
her	1
hands	1
pressed	1
against	1
each	1
other	1
and	1
interlaced,	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
were	1
subtly	1
recharging	1
her	1
will.	1
The	1
eldest	1
by	1
some	1
years	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
Forsytes,	1
she	1
held	1
a	1
peculiar	1
position	1
amongst	1
them.	1
Opportunists	1
and	1
egotists	1
one	1
and	1
all	1
—	1
though	1
not,	1
indeed,	1
more	1
so	1
than	1
their	1
neighbours	1
—	1
they	1
quailed	1
before	1
her	1
incorruptible	1
figure,	1
and,	1
when	1
opportunities	1
were	1
too	1
strong,	1
what	1
could	1
they	1
do	1
but	1
avoid	1
her!	1
Twisting	1
his	1
long,	1
thin	1
legs,	1
James	1
went	1
on:	1
“Jolyon,	1
he	1
will	1
have	1
his	1
own	1
way.	1
He’s	1
got	1
no	1
children”—	1
and	1
stopped,	1
recollecting	1
the	1
continued	1
existence	1
of	1
old	1
Jolyon’s	1
son,	1
young	1
Jolyon,	1
June’s	1
father,	1
who	1
had	1
made	1
such	1
a	1
mess	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
done	1
for	1
himself	1
by	1
deserting	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
child	1
and	1
running	1
away	1
with	1
that	1
foreign	1
governess.	1
“Well,”	1
he	1
resumed	1
hastily,	1
“if	1
he	1
likes	1
to	1
do	1
these	1
things,	1
I	1
s’pose	1
he	1
can	1
afford	1
to.	1
Now,	1
what’s	1
he	1
going	1
to	1
give	1
her?	1
I	1
s’pose	1
he’ll	1
give	1
her	1
a	1
thousand	1
a	1
year;	1
he’s	1
got	1
nobody	1
else	1
to	1
leave	1
his	1
money	1
to.”	1
He	1
stretched	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
meet	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
dapper,	1
clean-shaven	1
man,	1
with	1
hardly	1
a	1
hair	1
on	1
his	1
head,	1
a	1
long,	1
broken	1
nose,	1
full	1
lips,	1
and	1
cold	1
grey	1
eyes	1
under	1
rectangular	1
brows.	1
“Well,	1
Nick,”	1
he	1
muttered,	1
“how	1
are	1
you?”	1
Nicholas	1
Forsyte,	1
with	1
his	1
bird-like	1
rapidity	1
and	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
a	1
preternaturally	1
sage	1
schoolboy	1
(he	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
large	1
fortune,	1
quite	1
legitimately,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
companies	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
director),	1
placed	1
within	1
that	1
cold	1
palm	1
the	1
tips	1
of	1
his	1
still	1
colder	1
fingers	1
and	1
hastily	1
withdrew	1
them.	1
“I’m	1
bad,”	1
he	1
said,	1
pouting	1
—“been	1
bad	1
all	1
the	1
week;	1
don’t	1
sleep	1
at	1
night.	1
The	1
doctor	1
can’t	1
tell	1
why.	1
He’s	1
a	1
clever	1
fellow,	1
or	1
I	1
shouldn’t	1
have	1
him,	1
but	1
I	1
get	1
nothing	1
out	1
of	1
him	1
but	1
bills.”	1
“Doctors!”	1
said	1
James,	1
coming	1
down	1
sharp	1
on	1
his	1
words:	1
“I’ve	1
had	1
all	1
the	1
doctors	1
in	1
London	1
for	1
one	1
or	1
another	1
of	1
us.	1
There’s	1
no	1
satisfaction	1
to	1
be	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
them;	1
they’ll	1
tell	1
you	1
anything.	1
There’s	1
Swithin,	1
now.	1
What	1
good	1
have	1
they	1
done	1
him?	1
There	1
he	1
is;	1
he’s	1
bigger	1
than	1
ever;	1
he’s	1
enormous;	1
they	1
can’t	1
get	1
his	1
weight	1
down.	1
Look	1
at	1
him!”	1
Swithin	1
Forsyte,	1
tall,	1
square,	1
and	1
broad,	1
with	1
a	1
chest	1
like	1
a	1
pouter	1
pigeon’s	1
in	1
its	1
plumage	1
of	1
bright	1
waistcoats,	1
came	1
strutting	1
towards	1
them.	1
“Er	1
—	1
how	1
are	1
you?”	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
his	1
dandified	1
way,	1
aspirating	1
the	1
‘h’	1
strongly	1
(this	1
difficult	1
letter	1
was	1
almost	1
absolutely	1
safe	1
in	1
his	1
keeping)—“how	1
are	1
you?”	1
Each	1
brother	1
wore	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
aggravation	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
two,	1
knowing	1
by	1
experience	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
try	1
to	1
eclipse	1
his	1
ailments.	1
“We	1
were	1
just	1
saying,”	1
said	1
James,	1
“that	1
you	1
don’t	1
get	1
any	1
thinner.”	1
Swithin	1
protruded	1
his	1
pale	1
round	1
eyes	1
with	1
the	1
effort	1
of	1
hearing.	1
“Thinner?	1
I’m	1
in	1
good	1
case,”	1
he	1
said,	1
leaning	1
a	1
little	1
forward,	1
“not	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
thread-papers	1
like	1
you!”	1
But,	1
afraid	1
of	1
losing	1
the	1
expansion	1
of	1
his	1
chest,	1
he	1
leaned	1
back	1
again	1
into	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
immobility,	1
for	1
he	1
prized	1
nothing	1
so	1
highly	1
as	1
a	1
distinguished	1
appearance.	1
Aunt	1
Ann	1
turned	1
her	1
old	1
eyes	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
other.	1
Indulgent	1
and	1
severe	1
was	1
her	1
look.	1
In	1
turn	1
the	1
three	1
brothers	1
looked	1
at	1
Ann.	1
She	1
was	1
getting	1
shaky.	1
Wonderful	1
woman!	1
Eighty-six	1
if	1
a	1
day;	1
might	1
live	1
another	1
ten	1
years,	1
and	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
strong.	1
Swithin	1
and	1
James,	1
the	1
twins,	1
were	1
only	1
seventy-five,	1
Nicholas	1
a	1
mere	1
baby	1
of	1
seventy	1
or	1
so.	1
All	1
were	1
strong,	1
and	1
the	1
inference	1
was	1
comforting.	1
Of	1
all	1
forms	1
of	1
property	1
their	1
respective	1
healths	1
naturally	1
concerned	1
them	1
most.	1
“I’m	1
very	1
well	1
in	1
myself,”	1
proceeded	1
James,	1
“but	1
my	1
nerves	1
are	1
out	1
of	1
order.	1
The	1
least	1
thing	1
worries	1
me	1
to	1
death.	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Bath.”	1
“Bath!”	1
said	1
Nicholas.	1
“I’ve	1
tried	1
Harrogate.	1
That’s	1
no	1
good.	1
What	1
I	1
want	1
is	1
sea	1
air.	1
There’s	1
nothing	1
like	1
Yarmouth.	1
Now,	1
when	1
I	1
go	1
there	1
I	1
sleep.	1
.	3
”	1
“My	1
liver’s	1
very	1
bad,”	1
interrupted	1
Swithin	1
slowly.	1
“Dreadful	1
pain	1
here;”	1
and	1
he	1
placed	1
his	1
hand	1
on	1
his	1
right	1
side.	1
“Want	1
of	1
exercise,”	1
muttered	1
James,	1
his	1
eyes	1
on	1
the	1
china.	1
He	1
quickly	1
added:	1
“I	1
get	1
a	1
pain	1
there,	1
too.”	1
Swithin	1
reddened,	1
a	1
resemblance	1
to	1
a	1
turkey-cock	1
coming	1
upon	1
his	1
old	1
face.	1
“Exercise!”	1
he	1
said.	1
“I	1
take	1
plenty:	1
I	1
never	1
use	1
the	1
lift	1
at	1
the	1
Club.”	1
“I	1
didn’t	1
know,”	1
James	1
hurried	1
out.	1
“I	1
know	1
nothing	1
about	1
anybody;	1
nobody	1
tells	1
me	1
anything.	1
.	3
”	1
Swithin	1
fixed	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
stare:	1
“What	1
do	1
you	1
do	1
for	1
a	1
pain	1
there?”	1
James	1
brightened.	1
“I	1
take	1
a	1
compound.	1
.	3
”	1
“How	1
are	1
you,	1
uncle?”	1
June	1
stood	1
before	1
him,	1
her	1
resolute	1
small	1
face	1
raised	1
from	1
her	1
little	1
height	1
to	1
his	1
great	1
height,	1
and	1
her	1
hand	1
outheld.	1
The	1
brightness	1
faded	1
from	1
James’s	1
visage.	1
“How	1
are	1
you?”	1
he	1
said,	1
brooding	1
over	1
her.	1
“So	1
you’re	1
going	1
to	1
Wales	1
to-morrow	1
to	1
visit	1
your	1
young	1
man’s	1
aunts?	1
You’ll	1
have	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
rain	1
there.	1
This	1
isn’t	1
real	1
old	1
Worcester.”	1
He	1
tapped	1
the	1
bowl.	1
“Now,	1
that	1
set	1
I	1
gave	1
your	1
mother	1
when	1
she	1
married	1
was	1
the	1
genuine	1
thing.”	1
June	1
shook	1
hands	1
one	1
by	1
one	1
with	1
her	1
three	1
great-uncles,	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
Aunt	1
Ann.	1
A	1
very	1
sweet	1
look	1
had	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
old	1
lady’s	1
face,	1
she	1
kissed	1
the	1
girl’s	1
check	1
with	1
trembling	1
fervour.	1
“Well,	1
my	1
dear,”	1
she	1
said,	1
“and	1
so	1
you’re	1
going	1
for	1
a	1
whole	1
month!”	1
The	1
girl	1
passed	1
on,	1
and	1
Aunt	1
Ann	1
looked	1
after	1
her	1
slim	1
little	1
figure.	1
The	1
old	1
lady’s	1
round,	1
steel	1
grey	1
eyes,	1
over	1
which	1
a	1
film	1
like	1
a	1
bird’s	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
come,	1
followed	1
her	1
wistfully	1
amongst	1
the	1
bustling	1
crowd,	1
for	1
people	1
were	1
beginning	1
to	1
say	1
good-bye;	1
and	1
her	1
finger-tips,	1
pressing	1
and	1
pressing	1
against	1
each	1
other,	1
were	1
busy	1
again	1
with	1
the	1
recharging	1
of	1
her	1
will	1
against	1
that	1
inevitable	1
ultimate	1
departure	1
of	1
her	1
own.	1
‘Yes,’	1
she	1
thought,	1
‘everybody’s	1
been	1
most	1
kind;	1
quite	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
people	1
come	1
to	1
congratulate	1
her.	1
She	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
happy.’	1
Amongst	1
the	1
throng	1
of	1
people	1
by	1
the	1
door,	1
the	1
well-dressed	1
throng	1
drawn	1
from	1
the	1
families	1
of	1
lawyers	1
and	1
doctors,	1
from	1
the	1
Stock	1
Exchange,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
innumerable	1
avocations	1
of	1
the	1
upper-middle	1
class	1
—	1
there	1
were	1
only	1
some	1
twenty	1
percent	1
of	1
Forsytes;	1
but	1
to	1
Aunt	1
Ann	1
they	1
seemed	1
all	1
Forsytes	1
—	1
and	1
certainly	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
much	1
difference	1
—	1
she	1
saw	1
only	1
her	1
own	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood.	1
It	1
was	1
her	1
world,	1
this	1
family,	1
and	1
she	1
knew	1
no	1
other,	1
had	1
never	1
perhaps	1
known	1
any	1
other.	1
All	1
their	1
little	1
secrets,	1
illnesses,	1
engagements,	1
and	1
marriages,	1
how	1
they	1
were	1
getting	1
on,	1
and	1
whether	1
they	1
were	1
making	1
money	1
—	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
her	1
property,	1
her	1
delight,	1
her	1
life;	1
beyond	1
this	1
only	1
a	1
vague,	1
shadowy	1
mist	1
of	1
facts	1
and	1
persons	1
of	1
no	1
real	1
significance.	1
This	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
lay	1
down	1
when	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
her	1
turn	1
to	1
die;	1
this	1
which	1
gave	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
importance,	1
that	1
secret	1
self-importance,	1
without	1
which	1
none	1
of	1
us	1
can	1
bear	1
to	1
live;	1
and	1
to	1
this	1
she	1
clung	1
wistfully,	1
with	1
a	1
greed	1
that	1
grew	1
each	1
day!	1
If	1
life	1
were	1
slipping	1
away	1
from	1
her,	1
this	1
she	1
would	1
retain	1
to	1
the	1
end.	1
She	1
thought	1
of	1
June’s	1
father,	1
young	1
Jolyon,	1
who	1
had	1
run	1
away	1
with	1
that	1
foreign	1
girl.	1
And	1
what	1
a	1
sad	1
blow	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
all.	1
Such	1
a	1
promising	1
young	1
fellow!	1
A	1
sad	1
blow,	1
though	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
no	1
public	1
scandal,	1
most	1
fortunately,	1
Jo’s	1
wife	1
seeking	1
for	1
no	1
divorce!	1
A	1
long	1
time	1
ago!	1
And	1
when	1
June’s	1
mother	1
died,	1
six	1
years	1
ago,	1
Jo	1
had	1
married	1
that	1
woman,	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
two	1
children	1
now,	1
so	1
she	1
had	1
heard.	1
Still,	1
he	1
had	1
forfeited	1
his	1
right	1
to	1
be	1
there,	1
had	1
cheated	1
her	1
of	1
the	1
complete	1
fulfilment	1
of	1
her	1
family	1
pride,	1
deprived	1
her	1
of	1
the	1
rightful	1
pleasure	1
of	1
seeing	1
and	1
kissing	1
him	1
of	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
proud,	1
such	1
a	1
promising	1
young	1
fellow!	1
The	1
thought	1
rankled	1
with	1
the	1
bitterness	1
of	1
a	1
long-inflicted	1
injury	1
in	1
her	1
tenacious	1
old	1
heart.	1
A	1
little	1
water	1
stood	1
in	1
her	1
eyes.	1
With	1
a	1
handkerchief	1
of	1
the	1
finest	1
lawn	1
she	1
wiped	1
them	1
stealthily.	1
“Well,	1
Aunt	1
Ann?”	1
said	1
a	1
voice	1
behind.	1
Soames	1
Forsyte,	1
flat-shouldered,	1
clean-shaven,	1
flat-cheeked,	1
flat-waisted,	1
yet	1
with	1
something	1
round	1
and	1
secret	1
about	1
his	1
whole	1
appearance,	1
looked	1
downwards	1
and	1
aslant	1
at	1
Aunt	1
Ann,	1
as	1
though	1
trying	1
to	1
see	1
through	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
nose.	1
“And	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
engagement?”	1
he	1
asked.	1
Aunt	1
Ann’s	1
eyes	1
rested	1
on	1
him	1
proudly;	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
nephews	1
since	1
young	1
Jolyon’s	1
departure	1
from	1
the	1
family	1
nest,	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
her	1
favourite,	1
for	1
she	1
recognised	1
in	1
him	1
a	1
sure	1
trustee	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
soul	1
that	1
must	1
so	1
soon	1
slip	1
beyond	1
her	1
keeping.	1
“Very	1
nice	1
for	1
the	1
young	1
man,”	1
she	1
said;	1
“and	1
he’s	1
a	1
good-looking	1
young	1
fellow;	1
but	1
I	1
doubt	1
if	1
he’s	1
quite	1
the	1
right	1
lover	1
for	1
dear	1
June.”	1
Soames	1
touched	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
a	1
gold-lacquered	1
lustre.	1
“She’ll	1
tame	1
him,”	1
he	1
said,	1
stealthily	1
wetting	1
his	1
finger	1
and	1
rubbing	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
knobby	1
bulbs.	1
“That’s	1
genuine	1
old	1
lacquer;	1
you	1
can’t	1
get	1
it	1
nowadays.	1
It’d	1
do	1
well	1
in	1
a	1
sale	1
at	1
Jobson’s.”	1
He	1
spoke	1
with	1
relish,	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
cheering	1
up	1
his	1
old	1
aunt.	1
It	1
was	1
seldom	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
confidential.	1
“I	1
wouldn’t	1
mind	1
having	1
it	1
myself,”	1
he	1
added;	1
“you	1
can	1
always	1
get	1
your	1
price	1
for	1
old	1
lacquer.”	1
“You’re	1
so	1
clever	1
with	1
all	1
those	1
things,”	1
said	1
Aunt	1
Ann.	1
“And	1
how	1
is	1
dear	1
Irene?”	1
Soames’s	1
smile	1
died.	1
“Pretty	1
well,”	1
he	1
said.	1
“Complains	1
she	1
can’t	1
sleep;	1
she	1
sleeps	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
better	1
than	1
I	1
do,”	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
wife,	1
who	1
was	1
talking	1
to	1
Bosinney	1
by	1
the	1
door.	1
Aunt	1
Ann	1
sighed.	1
“Perhaps,”	1
she	1
said,	1
“it	1
will	1
be	1
just	1
as	1
well	1
for	1
her	1
not	1
to	1
see	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
June.	1
She’s	1
such	1
a	1
decided	1
character,	1
dear	1
June!”	1
Soames	1
flushed;	1
his	1
flushes	1
passed	1
rapidly	1
over	1
his	1
flat	1
cheeks	1
and	1
centered	1
between	1
his	1
eyes,	1
where	1
they	1
remained,	1
the	1
stamp	1
of	1
disturbing	1
thoughts.	1
“I	1
don’t	1
know	1
what	1
she	1
sees	1
in	1
that	1
little	1
flibbertigibbet,”	1
he	1
burst	1
out,	1
but	1
noticing	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
no	1
longer	1
alone,	1
he	1
turned	1
and	1
again	1
began	1
examining	1
the	1
lustre.	1
“They	1
tell	1
me	1
Jolyon’s	1
bought	1
another	1
house,”	1
said	1
his	1
father’s	1
voice	1
close	1
by;	1
“he	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
money	1
—	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
more	1
money	1
than	1
he	1
knows	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
with!	1
Montpellier	1
Square,	1
they	1
say;	1
close	1
to	1
Soames!	1
They	1
never	1
told	1
me,	1
Irene	1
never	1
tells	1
me	1
anything!”	1
“Capital	1
position,	1
not	1
two	1
minutes	1
from	1
me,”	1
said	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
Swithin,	1
“and	1
from	1
my	1
rooms	1
I	1
can	1
drive	1
to	1
the	1
Club	1
in	1
eight.”	1
The	1
position	1
of	1
their	1
houses	1
was	1
of	1
vital	1
importance	1
to	1
the	1
Forsytes,	1
nor	1
was	1
this	1
remarkable,	1
since	1
the	1
whole	1
spirit	1
of	1
their	1
success	1
was	1
embodied	1
therein.	1
Their	1
father,	1
of	1
farming	1
stock,	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
Dorsetshire	1
near	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
century.	1
‘Superior	1
Dosset	1
Forsyte,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
called	1
by	1
his	1
intimates,	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
stonemason	1
by	1
trade,	1
and	1
risen	1
to	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
a	1
master-builder.	1
Towards	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
he	1
moved	1
to	1
London,	1
where,	1
building	1
on	1
until	1
he	1
died,	1
he	1
was	1
buried	1
at	1
Highgate.	1
He	1
left	1
over	1
thirty	1
thousand	1
pounds	1
between	1
his	1
ten	1
children.	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
alluded	1
to	1
him,	1
if	1
at	1
all,	1
as	1
‘A	1
hard,	1
thick	1
sort	1
of	1
man;	1
not	1
much	1
refinement	1
about	1
him.’	1
The	1
second	1
generation	1
of	1
Forsytes	1
felt	1
indeed	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
greatly	1
to	1
their	1
credit.	1
The	1
only	1
aristocratic	1
trait	1
they	1
could	1
find	1
in	1
his	1
character	1
was	1
a	1
habit	1
of	1
drinking	1
Madeira.	1
Aunt	1
Hester,	1
an	1
authority	1
on	1
family	1
history,	1
described	1
him	1
thus:	1
“I	1
don’t	1
recollect	1
that	1
he	1
ever	1
did	1
anything;	1
at	1
least,	1
not	1
in	1
my	1
time.	1
He	1
was	1
er	1
—	1
an	1
owner	1
of	1
houses,	1
my	1
dear.	1
His	1
hair	1
about	1
your	1
Uncle	1
Swithin’s	1
colour;	1
rather	1
a	1
square	1
build.	1
Tall?	1
No	1
—	1
not	1
very	1
tall”	1
(he	1
had	1
been	1
five	1
feet	1
five,	1
with	1
a	1
mottled	1
face);	1
“a	1
fresh-coloured	1
man.	1
I	1
remember	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
drink	1
Madeira;	1
but	1
ask	1
your	1
Aunt	1
Ann.	1
What	1
was	1
his	1
father?	1
He	1
—	1
er	1
—	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
land	1
down	1
in	1
Dorsetshire,	1
by	1
the	1
sea.”	1
James	1
once	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
see	1
for	1
himself	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
place	1
this	1
was	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
from.	1
He	1
found	1
two	1
old	1
farms,	1
with	1
a	1
cart	1
track	1
rutted	1
into	1
the	1
pink	1
earth,	1
leading	1
down	1
to	1
a	1
mill	1
by	1
the	1
beach;	1
a	1
little	1
grey	1
church	1
with	1
a	1
buttressed	1
outer	1
wall,	1
and	1
a	1
smaller	1
and	1
greyer	1
chapel.	1
The	1
stream	1
which	1
worked	1
the	1
mill	1
came	1
bubbling	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
dozen	1
rivulets,	1
and	1
pigs	1
were	1
hunting	1
round	1
that	1
estuary.	1
A	1
haze	1
hovered	1
over	1
the	1
prospect.	1
Down	1
this	1
hollow,	1
with	1
their	1
feet	1
deep	1
in	1
the	1
mud	1
and	1
their	1
faces	1
towards	1
the	1
sea,	1
it	1
appeared	1
that	1
the	1
primeval	1
Forsytes	1
had	1
been	1
content	1
to	1
walk	1
Sunday	1
after	1
Sunday	1
for	1
hundreds	1
of	1
years.	1
Whether	1
or	1
no	1
James	1
had	1
cherished	1
hopes	1
of	1
an	1
inheritance,	1
or	1
of	1
something	1
rather	1
distinguished	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
down	1
there,	1
he	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
town	1
in	1
a	1
poor	1
way,	1
and	1
went	1
about	1
with	1
a	1
pathetic	1
attempt	1
at	1
making	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
a	1
bad	1
job.	1
“There’s	1
very	1
little	1
to	1
be	1
had	1
out	1
of	1
that,”	1
he	1
said;	1
“regular	1
country	1
little	1
place,	1
old	1
as	1
the	1
hills.	1
.	3
”	1
Its	1
age	1
was	1
felt	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
comfort.	1
Old	1
Jolyon,	1
in	1
whom	1
a	1
desperate	1
honesty	1
welled	1
up	1
at	1
times,	1
would	1
allude	1
to	1
his	1
ancestors	1
as:	1
“Yeomen	1
—	1
I	1
suppose	1
very	1
small	1
beer.”	1
Yet	1
he	1
would	1
repeat	1
the	1
word	1
‘yeomen’	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
afforded	1
him	1
consolation.	1
They	1
had	1
all	1
done	1
so	1
well	1
for	1
themselves,	1
these	1
Forsytes,	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
what	1
is	1
called	1
‘of	1
a	1
certain	1
position.’	1
They	1
had	1
shares	1
in	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
things,	1
not	1
as	1
yet	1
—	1
with	1
the	1
exception	1
of	1
Timothy	1
—	1
in	1
consols,	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
dread	1
in	1
life	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
3	1
per	1
cent.	1
for	1
their	1
money.	1
They	1
collected	1
pictures,	1
too,	1
and	1
were	1
supporters	1
of	1
such	1
charitable	1
institutions	1
as	1
might	1
be	1
beneficial	1
to	1
their	1
sick	1
domestics.	1
From	1
their	1
father,	1
the	1
builder,	1
they	1
inherited	1
a	1
talent	1
for	1
bricks	1
and	1
mortar.	1
Originally,	1
perhaps,	1
members	1
of	1
some	1
primitive	1
sect,	1
they	1
were	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
natural	1
course	1
of	1
things	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
Church	1
of	1
England,	1
and	1
caused	1
their	1
wives	1
and	1
children	1
to	1
attend	1
with	1
some	1
regularity	1
the	1
more	1
fashionable	1
churches	1
of	1
the	1
Metropolis.	1
To	1
have	1
doubted	1
their	1
Christianity	1
would	1
have	1
caused	1
them	1
both	1
pain	1
and	1
surprise.	1
Some	1
of	1
them	1
paid	1
for	1
pews,	1
thus	1
expressing	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
practical	1
form	1
their	1
sympathy	1
with	1
the	1
teachings	1
of	1
Christ.	1
Their	1
residences,	1
placed	1
at	1
stated	1
intervals	1
round	1
the	1
park,	1
watched	1
like	1
sentinels,	1
lest	1
the	1
fair	1
heart	1
of	1
this	1
London,	1
where	1
their	1
desires	1
were	1
fixed,	1
should	1
slip	1
from	1
their	1
clutches,	1
and	1
leave	1
them	1
lower	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
estimations.	1
There	1
was	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
in	1
Stanhope	1
Place;	1
the	1
Jameses	1
in	1
Park	1
Lane;	1
Swithin	1
in	1
the	1
lonely	1
glory	1
of	1
orange	1
and	1
blue	1
chambers	1
in	1
Hyde	1
Park	1
Mansions	1
—	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
married,	1
not	1
he	1
—	1
the	1
Soamses	1
in	1
their	1
nest	1
off	1
Knightsbridge;	1
the	1
Rogers	1
in	1
Prince’s	1
Gardens	1
(Roger	1
was	1
that	1
remarkable	1
Forsyte	1
who	1
had	1
conceived	1
and	1
carried	1
out	1
the	1
notion	1
of	1
bringing	1
up	1
his	1
four	1
sons	1
to	1
a	1
new	1
profession.	1
“Collect	1
house	1
property,	1
nothing	1
like	1
it,”	1
he	1
would	1
say;	1
“I	1
never	1
did	1
anything	1
else”).	1
The	1
Haymans	1
again	1
—	1
Mrs.	1
Hayman	1
was	1
the	1
one	1
married	1
Forsyte	1
sister	1
—	1
in	1
a	1
house	1
high	1
up	1
on	1
Campden	1
Hill,	1
shaped	1
like	1
a	1
giraffe,	1
and	1
so	1
tall	1
that	1
it	1
gave	1
the	1
observer	1
a	1
crick	1
in	1
the	1
neck;	1
the	1
Nicholases	1
in	1
Ladbroke	1
Grove,	1
a	1
spacious	1
abode	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
bargain;	1
and	1
last,	1
but	1
not	1
least,	1
Timothy’s	1
on	1
the	1
Bayswater	1
Road,	1
where	1
Ann,	1
and	1
Juley,	1
and	1
Hester,	1
lived	1
under	1
his	1
protection.	1
But	1
all	1
this	1
time	1
James	1
was	1
musing,	1
and	1
now	1
he	1
inquired	1
of	1
his	1
host	1
and	1
brother	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
for	1
that	1
house	1
in	1
Montpellier	1
Square.	1
He	1
himself	1
had	2
his	1
eye	1
on	1
a	1
house	1
there	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
two	1
years,	1
but	1
they	1
wanted	1
such	1
a	1
price.	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
recounted	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
his	1
purchase.	1
“Twenty-two	1
years	1
to	1
run?”	1
repeated	1
James;	1
“The	1
very	1
house	1
I	1
was	1
after	1
—	1
you’ve	1
given	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
it!”	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
frowned.	1
“It’s	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
want	1
it,”	1
said	1
James	1
hastily;	1
it	1
wouldn’t	1
suit	1
my	1
purpose	1
at	1
that	1
price.	1
Soames	1
knows	1
the	1
house,	1
well	1
—	1
he’ll	1
tell	1
you	1
it’s	1
too	1
dear	1
—	1
his	1
opinion’s	1
worth	1
having.”	1
“I	1
don’t,”	1
said	1
old	1
Jolyon,	1
“care	1
a	1
fig	1
for	1
his	1
opinion.”	1
“Well,”	1
murmured	1
James,	1
“you	1
will	1
have	1
your	1
own	1
way	1
—	1
it’s	1
a	1
good	1
opinion.	1
Good-bye!	1
We’re	1
going	1
to	1
drive	1
down	1
to	1
Hurlingham.	1
They	1
tell	1
me	1
June’s	1
going	1
to	1
Wales.	1
You’ll	1
be	1
lonely	1
tomorrow.	1
What’ll	1
you	1
do	1
with	1
yourself?	1
You’d	1
better	1
come	1
and	1
dine	1
with	1
us!”	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
refused.	1
He	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
front	1
door	1
and	1
saw	1
them	1
into	1
their	1
barouche,	1
and	1
twinkled	1
at	1
them,	1
having	1
already	1
forgotten	1
his	1
spleen	1
—	1
Mrs.	1
James	1
facing	1
the	1
horses,	1
tall	1
and	1
majestic	1
with	1
auburn	1
hair;	1
on	1
her	1
left,	1
Irene	1
—	1
the	1
two	1
husbands,	1
father	1
and	1
son,	1
sitting	1
forward,	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
expected	1
something,	1
opposite	1
their	1
wives.	1
Bobbing	1
and	1
bounding	1
upon	1
the	1
spring	1
cushions,	1
silent,	1
swaying	1
to	1
each	1
motion	1
of	1
their	1
chariot,	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
watched	1
them	1
drive	1
away	1
under	1
the	1
sunlight.	1
During	1
the	1
drive	1
the	1
silence	1
was	1
broken	1
by	1
Mrs.	1
James.	1
“Did	1
you	1
ever	1
see	1
such	1
a	1
collection	1
of	1
rumty-too	1
people?”	1
Soames,	1
glancing	1
at	1
her	1
beneath	1
his	1
eyelids,	1
nodded,	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
Irene	1
steal	1
at	1
him	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
unfathomable	1
looks.	1
It	1
is	1
likely	1
enough	1
that	1
each	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
Forsyte	1
family	1
made	1
that	1
remark	1
as	1
they	1
drove	1
away	1
from	1
old	1
Jolyon’s	1
‘At	1
Home!’	1
Amongst	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
the	1
departing	1
guests	1
the	1
fourth	1
and	1
fifth	1
brothers,	1
Nicholas	1
and	1
Roger,	1
walked	1
away	1
together,	1
directing	1
their	1
steps	1
alongside	1
Hyde	1
Park	1
towards	1
the	1
Praed	1
Street	1
Station	1
of	1
the	1
Underground.	1
Like	1
all	1
other	1
Forsytes	1
of	1
a	1
certain	1
age	1
they	1
kept	1
carriages	1
of	1
their	1
own,	1
and	1
never	1
took	1
cabs	1
if	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
they	1
could	1
avoid	1
it.	1
The	1
day	1
was	1
bright,	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
the	1
Park	1
in	1
the	1
full	1
beauty	1
of	1
mid-June	1
foliage;	1
the	1
brothers	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
notice	1
phenomena,	1
which	1
contributed,	1
nevertheless,	1
to	1
the	1
jauntiness	1
of	1
promenade	1
and	1
conversation.	1
“Yes,”	1
said	1
Roger,	1
“she’s	1
a	1
good-lookin’	1
woman,	1
that	1
wife	1
of	1
Soames’s.	1
I’m	1
told	1
they	1
don’t	1
get	1
on.”	1
This	1
brother	1
had	1
a	1
high	1
forehead,	1
and	1
the	1
freshest	1
colour	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
Forsytes;	1
his	1
light	1
grey	1
eyes	1
measured	1
the	1
street	1
frontage	1
of	1
the	1
houses	1
by	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
would	1
level	1
his,	1
umbrella	1
and	1
take	1
a	1
‘lunar,’	1
as	1
he	1
expressed	1
it,	1
of	1
the	1
varying	1
heights.	1
“She’d	1
no	1
money,”	1
replied	1
Nicholas.	1
He	1
himself	1
had	1
married	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
of	1
money,	1
of	1
which,	1
it	1
being	1
then	1
the	1
golden	1
age	1
before	1
the	1
Married	1
Women’s	1
Property	1
Act,	1
he	1
had	1
mercifully	1
been	1
enabled	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
successful	1
use.	1
“What	1
was	1
her	1
father?”	1
“Heron	1
was	1
his	1
name,	1
a	1
Professor,	1
so	1
they	1
tell	1
me.”	1
Roger	1
shook	1
his	1
head.	1
“There’s	1
no	1
money	1
in	1
that,”	1
he	1
said.	1
“They	1
say	1
her	1
mother’s	1
father	1
was	1
cement.”	1
Roger’s	1
face	1
brightened.	1
“But	1
he	1
went	1
bankrupt,”	1
went	1
on	1
Nicholas.	1
“Ah!”	1
exclaimed	1
Roger,	1
“Soames	1
will	1
have	1
trouble	1
with	1
her;	1
you	1
mark	1
my	1
words,	1
he’ll	1
have	1
trouble	1
—	1
she’s	1
got	1
a	1
foreign	1
look.”	1
Nicholas	1
licked	1
his	1
lips.	1
“She’s	1
a	1
pretty	1
woman,”	1
and	1
he	1
waved	1
aside	1
a	1
crossing-sweeper.	1
“How	1
did	1
he	1
get	1
hold	1
of	1
her?”	1
asked	1
Roger	1
presently.	1
“She	1
must	1
cost	1
him	1
a	1
pretty	1
penny	1
in	1
dress!”	1
“Ann	1
tells	1
me,”	1
replied	1
Nicholas,	1
“he	1
was	1
half-cracked	1
about	1
her.	1
She	1
refused	1
him	1
five	1
times.	1
James,	1
he’s	1
nervous	1
about	1
it,	1
I	1
can	1
see.”	1
“Ah!”	1
said	1
Roger	1
again;	1
“I’m	1
sorry	1
for	1
James;	1
he	1
had	1
trouble	1
with	1
Dartie.”	1
His	1
pleasant	1
colour	1
was	1
heightened	1
by	1
exercise,	1
he	1
swung	1
his	1
umbrella	1
to	1
the	1
level	1
of	1
his	1
eye	1
more	1
frequently	1
than	1
ever.	1
Nicholas’s	1
face	1
also	1
wore	1
a	1
pleasant	1
look.	1
“Too	1
pale	1
for	1
me,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“but	1
her	1
figures	1
capital!”	1
Roger	1
made	1
no	1
reply.	1
“I	1
call	1
her	1
distinguished-looking,”	1
he	1
said	1
at	1
last	1
—	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
highest	1
praise	1
in	1
the	1
Forsyte	1
vocabulary.	1
“That	1
young	1
Bosinney	1
will	1
never	1
do	1
any	1
good	1
for	1
himself.	1
They	1
say	1
at	1
Burkitt’s	1
he’s	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
artistic	1
chaps	1
—	1
got	1
an	1
idea	1
of	1
improving	1
English	1
architecture;	1
there’s	1
no	1
money	1
in	1
that!	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
hear	1
what	1
Timothy	1
would	1
say	1
to	1
it.”	1
They	1
entered	1
the	1
station.	1
“What	1
class	1
are	1
you	1
going?	1
I	1
go	1
second.”	1
“No	1
second	1
for	1
me,”	1
said	1
Nicholas;	1
—“you	1
never	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
may	1
catch.”	1
He	1
took	1
a	1
first-class	1
ticket	1
to	1
Notting	1
Hill	1
Gate;	1
Roger	1
a	1
second	1
to	1
South	1
Kensington.	1
The	1
train	1
coming	1
in	1
a	1
minute	1
later,	1
the	1
two	1
brothers	1
parted	1
and	1
entered	1
their	1
respective	1
compartments.	1
Each	1
felt	1
aggrieved	1
that	1
the	1
other	1
had	1
not	1
modified	1
his	1
habits	1
to	1
secure	1
his	1
society	1
a	1
little	1
longer;	1
but	1
as	1
Roger	1
voiced	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
thoughts:	1
‘Always	1
a	1
stubborn	1
beggar,	1
Nick!’	1
And	1
as	1
Nicholas	1
expressed	1
it	1
to	1
himself:	1
‘Cantankerous	1
chap	1
Roger	1
—	1
always	1
was!’	1
There	1
was	1
little	1
sentimentality	1
about	1
the	1
Forsytes.	1
In	1
that	1
great	1
London,	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
conquered	1
and	1
become	1
merged	1
in,	1
what	1
time	1
had	1
they	1
to	1
be	1
sentimental?	1
Chapter	1

Old	1
Jolyon	1
Goes	1
to	1
the	1
Opera	1
At	1
five	1
o’clock	1
the	1
following	1
day	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
sat	1
alone,	1
a	1
cigar	1
between	1
his	1
lips,	1
and	1
on	1
a	1
table	1
by	1
his	1
side	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
tea.	1
He	1
was	1
tired,	1
and	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
his	1
cigar	1
he	1
fell	1
asleep.	1
A	1
fly	1
settled	1
on	1
his	1
hair,	1
his	1
breathing	1
sounded	1
heavy	1
in	1
the	1
drowsy	1
silence,	1
his	1
upper	1
lip	1
under	1
the	1
white	1
moustache	1
puffed	1
in	1
and	1
out.	1
From	1
between	1
the	1
fingers	1
of	1
his	1
veined	1
and	1
wrinkled	1
hand	1
the	1
cigar,	1
dropping	1
on	1
the	1
empty	1
hearth,	1
burned	1
itself	1
out.	1
The	1
gloomy	1
little	1
study,	1
with	1
windows	1
of	1
stained	1
glass	1
to	1
exclude	1
the	1
view,	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
dark	1
green	1
velvet	1
and	1
heavily-carved	1
mahogany	1
—	1
a	1
suite	1
of	1
which	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
was	1
wont	1
to	1
say:	1
‘Shouldn’t	1
wonder	1
if	1
it	1
made	1
a	1
big	1
price	1
some	1
day!’	1
It	1
was	1
pleasant	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
after	1
life	1
he	1
could	1
get	1
more	1
for	1
things	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
given.	1
In	1
the	1
rich	1
brown	1
atmosphere	1
peculiar	1
to	1
back	1
rooms	1
in	1
the	1
mansion	1
of	1
a	1
Forsyte,	1
the	1
Rembrandtesque	1
effect	1
of	1
his	1
great	1
head,	1
with	1
its	1
white	1
hair,	1
against	1
the	1
cushion	1
of	1
his	1
high-backed	1
seat,	1
was	1
spoiled	1
by	1
the	1
moustache,	1
which	1
imparted	1
a	1
somewhat	1
military	1
look	1
to	1
his	1
face.	1
An	1
old	1
clock	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
with	1
him	1
since	1
before	1
his	1
marriage	1
forty	1
years	1
ago	1
kept	1
with	1
its	1
ticking	1
a	1
jealous	1
record	1
of	1
the	1
seconds	1
slipping	1
away	1
forever	1
from	1
its	1
old	1
master.	1
He	1
had	1
never	1
cared	1
for	1
this	1
room,	1
hardly	1
going	1
into	1
it	1
from	1
one	1
year’s	1
end	1
to	1
another,	1
except	1
to	1
take	1
cigars	1
from	1
the	1
Japanese	1
cabinet	1
in	1
the	1
corner,	1
and	1
the	1
room	1
now	1
had	1
its	1
revenge.	1
His	1
temples,	1
curving	1
like	1
thatches	1
over	1
the	1
hollows	1
beneath,	1
his	1
cheek-bones	1
and	1
chin,	1
all	1
were	1
sharpened	1
in	1
his	1
sleep,	1
and	1
there	1
had	1
come	1
upon	1
his	1
face	1
the	1
confession	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
an	1
old	1
man.	1
He	1
woke.	1
June	1
had	1
gone!	1
James	1
had	1
said	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
lonely.	1
James	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
a	1
poor	1
thing.	1
He	1
recollected	1
with	1
satisfaction	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
bought	1
that	1
house	1
over	1
James’s	1
head.	1
Serve	1
him	1
right	1
for	1
sticking	1
at	1
the	1
price;	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
the	1
fellow	1
thought	1
of	1
was	1
money.	1
Had	1
he	1
given	1
too	1
much,	1
though?	1
It	1
wanted	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
doing	1
to	1
—	1
He	1
dared	1
say	1
he	1
would	1
want	1
all	1
his	1
money	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
with	1
this	1
affair	1
of	1
June’s.	1
He	1
ought	1
never	1
to	1
have	1
allowed	1
the	1
engagement.	1
She	1
had	1
met	1
this	1
Bosinney	1
at	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Baynes,	1
Baynes	1
and	1
Bildeboy,	1
the	1
architects.	1
He	1
believed	1
that	1
Baynes,	1
whom	1
he	1
knew	1
—	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
woman	1
—	1
was	1
the	1
young	1
man’s	1
uncle	1
by	1
marriage.	1
After	1
that	1
she’d	1
been	1
always	1
running	1
after	1
him;	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
took	1
a	1
thing	1
into	1
her	1
head	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
stopping	1
her.	1
She	1
was	1
continually	1
taking	1
up	1
with	1
‘lame	1
ducks’	1
of	1
one	1
sort	1
or	1
another.	1
This	1
fellow	1
had	1
no	1
money,	1
but	1
she	1
must	1
needs	1
become	1
engaged	1
to	1
him	1
—	1
a	1
harumscarum,	1
unpractical	1
chap,	1
who	1
would	1
get	1
himself	1
into	1
no	1
end	1
of	1
difficulties.	1
She	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
one	1
day	1
in	1
her	1
slap-dash	1
way	1
and	1
told	1
him;	1
and,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
any	1
consolation,	1
she	1
had	1
added:	1
“He’s	1
so	1
splendid;	1
he’s	1
often	1
lived	1
on	1
cocoa	1
for	1
a	1
week!”	1
“And	1
he	1
wants	1
you	1
to	1
live	1
on	1
cocoa	1
too?”	1
“Oh	1
no;	1
he	1
is	1
getting	1
into	1
the	1
swim	1
now.”	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
had	1
taken	1
his	1
cigar	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
white	1
moustaches,	1
stained	1
by	1
coffee	1
at	1
the	1
edge,	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
her,	1
that	1
little	1
slip	1
of	1
a	1
thing	1
who	1
had	1
got	1
such	1
a	1
grip	1
of	1
his	1
heart.	1
He	1
knew	1
more	1
about	1
‘swims’	1
than	1
his	1
granddaughter.	1
But	1
she,	1
having	1
clasped	1
her	1
hands	1
on	1
his	1
knees,	1
rubbed	1
her	1
chin	1
against	1
him,	1
making	1
a	1
sound	1
like	1
a	1
purring	1
cat.	1
And,	1
knocking	1
the	1
ash	1
off	1
his	1
cigar,	1
he	1
had	1
exploded	1
in	1
nervous	1
desperation:	1
“You’re	1
all	1
alike:	1
you	1
won’t	1
be	1
satisfied	1
till	1
you’ve	1
got	1
what	1
you	1
want.	1
If	1
you	1
must	1
come	1
to	1
grief,	1
you	1
must;	1
I	1
wash	1
my	1
hands	1
of	1
it.”	1
So,	1
he	1
had	1
washed	1
his	1
hands	1
of	1
it,	1
making	1
the	1
condition	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
marry	1
until	1
Bosinney	1
had	1
at	1
least	1
four	1
hundred	1
a	1
year.	1
“I	1
shan’t	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
very	1
much,”	1
he	1
had	1
said,	1
a	1
formula	1
to	1
which	1
June	1
was	1
not	1
unaccustomed.	1
“Perhaps	1
this	1
What’s-his-name	1
will	1
provide	1
the	1
cocoa.”	1
He	1
had	1
hardly	1
seen	1
anything	1
of	1
her	1
since	1
it	1
began.	1
A	1
bad	1
business!	1
He	1
had	1
no	1
notion	1
of	1
giving	1
her	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
money	1
to	1
enable	1
a	1
fellow	1
he	1
knew	1
nothing	1
about	1
to	1
live	1
on	1
in	1
idleness.	1
He	1
had	1
seen	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
thing	1
before;	1
no	1
good	1
ever	1
came	1
of	1
it.	1
Worst	1
of	1
all,	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
hope	1
of	1
shaking	1
her	1
resolution;	1
she	1
was	1
as	1
obstinate	1
as	1
a	1
mule,	1
always	1
had	1
been	1
from	1
a	1
child.	1
He	1
didn’t	1
see	1
where	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
end.	1
They	1
must	1
cut	1
their	1
coat	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
cloth.	1
He	1
would	1
not	1
give	1
way	1
till	1
he	1
saw	1
young	1
Bosinney	1
with	1
an	1
income	1
of	1
his	1
own.	1
That	1
June	1
would	1
have	1
trouble	1
with	1
the	1
fellow	1
was	1
as	1
plain	1
as	1
a	1
pikestaff;	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
more	1
idea	1
of	1
money	1
than	1
a	1
cow.	1
As	1
to	1
this	1
rushing	1
down	1
to	1
Wales	1
to	1
visit	1
the	1
young	1
man’s	1
aunts,	1
he	1
fully	1
expected	1
they	1
were	1
old	1
cats.	1
And,	1
motionless,	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
stared	1
at	1
the	1
wall;	1
but	1
for	1
his	1
open	1
eyes,	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
asleep.	1
.	3
The	1
idea	1
of	1
supposing	1
that	1
young	1
cub	1
Soames	1
could	1
give	1
him	1
advice!	1
He	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
a	1
cub,	1
with	1
his	1
nose	1
in	1
the	1
air!	1
He	1
would	1
be	1
setting	1
up	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
property	1
next,	1
with	1
a	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
country!	1
A	1
man	1
of	1
property!	1
H’mph!	1
Like	1
his	1
father,	1
he	1
was	1
always	1
nosing	1
out	1
bargains,	1
a	1
cold-blooded	1
young	1
beggar!	1
He	1
rose,	1
and,	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
cabinet,	1
began	1
methodically	1
stocking	1
his	1
cigar-case	1
from	1
a	1
bundle	1
fresh	1
in.	1
They	1
were	1
not	1
bad	1
at	1
the	1
price,	1
but	1
you	1
couldn’t	1
get	1
a	1
good	1
cigar,	1
nowadays,	1
nothing	1
to	1
hold	1
a	1
candle	1
to	1
those	1
old	1
Superfinos	1
of	1
Hanson	1
and	1
Bridger’s.	1
That	1
was	1
a	1
cigar!	1
The	1
thought,	1
like	1
some	1
stealing	1
perfume,	1
carried	1
him	1
back	1
to	1
those	1
wonderful	1
nights	1
at	1
Richmond	1
when	1
after	1
dinner	1
he	1
sat	1
smoking	1
on	1
the	1
terrace	1
of	1
the	1
Crown	1
and	1
Sceptre	1
with	1
Nicholas	1
Treffry	1
and	1
Traquair	1
and	1
Jack	1
Herring	1
and	1
Anthony	1
Thornworthy.	1
How	1
good	1
his	1
cigars	1
were	1
then!	1
Poor	1
old	1
Nick!	1
—	1
dead,	1
and	1
Jack	1
Herring	1
—	1
dead,	1
and	1
Traquair	1
—	1
dead	1
of	1
that	1
wife	1
of	1
his,	1
and	1
Thornworthy	1
—	1
awfully	1
shaky	1
(no	1
wonder,	1
with	1
his	1
appetite).	1
Of	1
all	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
those	1
days	1
he	1
himself	1
alone	1
seemed	1
left,	1
except	1
Swithin,	1
of	1
course,	1
and	1
he	1
so	1
outrageously	1
big	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
doing	1
anything	1
with	1
him.	1
Difficult	1
to	1
believe	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
long	1
ago;	1
he	1
felt	1
young	1
still!	1
Of	1
all	1
his	1
thoughts,	1
as	1
he	1
stood	1
there	1
counting	1
his	1
cigars,	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
poignant,	1
the	1
most	1
bitter.	1
With	1
his	1
white	1
head	1
and	1
his	1
loneliness	1
he	1
had	1
remained	1
young	1
and	1
green	1
at	1
heart.	1
And	1
those	1
Sunday	1
afternoons	1
on	1
Hampstead	1
Heath,	1
when	1
young	1
Jolyon	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
for	1
a	1
stretch	1
along	1
the	1
Spaniard’s	1
Road	1
to	1
Highgate,	1
to	1
Child’s	1
Hill,	1
and	1
back	1
over	1
the	1
Heath	1
again	1
to	1
dine	1
at	1
Jack	1
Straw’s	1
Castle	1
—	1
how	1
delicious	1
his	1
cigars	1
were	1
then!	1
And	1
such	1
weather!	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
weather	1
now.	1
When	1
June	1
was	1
a	1
toddler	1
of	1
five,	1
and	1
every	1
other	1
Sunday	1
he	1
took	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
Zoo,	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
those	1
two	1
good	1
women,	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
her	1
grandmother,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
bear	1
den	1
baited	1
his	1
umbrella	1
with	1
buns	1
for	1
her	1
favourite	1
bears,	1
how	1
sweet	1
his	1
cigars	1
were	1
then!	1
Cigars!	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
even	1
succeeded	1
in	1
out-living	1
his	1
palate	1
—	1
the	1
famous	1
palate	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
fifties	1
men	1
swore	1
by,	1
and	1
speaking	1
of	1
him,	1
said:	1
“Forsyte’s	1
the	1
best	1
palate	1
in	1
London!”	1
The	1
palate	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
sense	1
had	1
made	1
his	1
fortune	1
—	1
the	1
fortune	1
of	1
the	1
celebrated	1
tea	1
men,	1
Forsyte	1
and	1
Treffry,	1
whose	1
tea,	1
like	1
no	1
other	1
man’s	1
tea,	1
had	1
a	1
romantic	1
aroma,	1
the	1
charm	1
of	1
a	1
quite	1
singular	1
genuineness.	1
About	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Forsyte	1
and	1
Treffry	1
in	1
the	1
City	1
had	1
clung	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
enterprise	1
and	1
mystery,	1
of	1
special	1
dealings	1
in	1
special	1
ships,	1
at	1
special	1
ports,	1
with	1
special	1
Orientals.	1
He	1
had	1
worked	1
at	1
that	1
business!	1
Men	1
did	1
work	1
in	1
those	1
days!	1
these	1
young	1
pups	1
hardly	1
knew	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
word.	1
He	1
had	1
gone	1
into	1
every	1
detail,	1
known	1
everything	1
that	1
went	1
on,	1
sometimes	1
sat	1
up	1
all	1
night	1
over	1
it.	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
chosen	1
his	1
agents	1
himself,	1
prided	1
himself	1
on	1
it.	1
His	1
eye	1
for	1
men,	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
say,	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
his	1
success,	1
and	1
the	1
exercise	1
of	1
this	1
masterful	1
power	1
of	1
selection	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
only	1
part	1
of	1
it	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
really	1
liked.	1
Not	1
a	1
career	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
his	1
ability.	1
Even	1
now,	1
when	1
the	1
business	1
had	1
been	1
turned	1
into	1
a	1
Limited	1
Liability	1
Company,	1
and	1
was	1
declining	1
(he	1
had	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
shares	1
long	1
ago),	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
sharp	1
chagrin	1
in	1
thinking	1
of	1
that	1
time.	1
How	1
much	1
better	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
done!	1
He	1
would	1
have	1
succeeded	1
splendidly	1
at	1
the	1
Bar!	1
He	1
had	1
even	1
thought	1
of	1
standing	1
for	1
Parliament.	1
How	1
often	1
had	1
not	1
Nicholas	1
Treffry	1
said	1
to	1
him:	1
“You	1
could	1
do	1
anything,	1
Jo,	1
if	1
you	1
weren’t	1
so	1
d-damned	1
careful	1
of	1
yourself!”	1
Dear	1
old	1
Nick!	1
Such	1
a	1
good	1
fellow,	1
but	1
a	1
racketty	1
chap!	1
The	1
notorious	1
Treffry!	1
He	1
had	1
never	1
taken	1
any	1
care	1
of	1
himself.	1
So	1
he	1
was	1
dead.	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
counted	1
his	1
cigars	1
with	1
a	1
steady	1
hand,	1
and	1
it	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
wonder	1
if	1
perhaps	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
too	1
careful	1
of	1
himself.	1
He	1
put	1
the	1
cigar-case	1
in	1
the	1
breast	1
of	1
his	1
coat,	1
buttoned	1
it	1
in,	1
and	1
walked	1
up	1
the	1
long	1
flights	1
to	1
his	1
bedroom,	1
leaning	1
on	1
one	1
foot	1
and	1
the	1
other,	1
and	1
helping	1
himself	1
by	1
the	1
bannister.	1
The	1
house	1
was	1
too	1
big.	1
After	1
June	1
was	1
married,	1
if	1
she	1
ever	1
did	1
marry	1
this	1
fellow,	1
as	1
he	1
supposed	1
she	1
would,	1
he	1
would	1
let	1
it	1
and	1
go	1
into	1
rooms.	1
What	1
was	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
keeping	1
half	1
a	1
dozen	1
servants	1
eating	1
their	1
heads	1
off?	1
The	1
butler	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
ring	1
of	1
his	1
bell	1
—	1
a	1
large	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
beard,	1
a	1
soft	1
tread,	1
and	1
a	1
peculiar	1
capacity	1
for	1
silence.	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
put	1
his	1
dress	1
clothes	1
out;	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
dine	1
at	1
the	1
Club.	1
How	1
long	1
had	1
the	1
carriage	1
been	1
back	1
from	1
taking	1
Miss	1
June	1
to	1
the	1
station?	1
Since	1
two?	1
Then	1
let	1
him	1
come	1
round	1
at	1
half-past	1
six!	1
The	1
Club	1
which	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
entered	1
on	1
the	1
stroke	1
of	1
seven	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
political	1
institutions	1
of	1
the	1
upper	1
middle	1
class	1
which	1
have	1
seen	1
better	1
days.	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
being	1
talked	1
about,	1
perhaps	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
being	1
talked	1
about,	1
it	1
betrayed	1
a	1
disappointing	1
vitality.	1
People	1
had	1
grown	1
tired	1
of	1
saying	1
that	1
the	1
‘Disunion’	1
was	1
on	1
its	1
last	1
legs.	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
would	1
say	1
it,	1
too,	1
yet	1
disregarded	1
the	1
fact	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
truly	1
irritating	1
to	1
well-constituted	1
Clubmen.	1
“Why	1
do	1
you	1
keep	1
your	1
name	1
on?”	1
Swithin	1
often	1
asked	1
him	1
with	1
profound	1
vexation.	1
“Why	1
don’t	1
you	1
join	1
the	1
‘Polyglot’?	1
You	1
can’t	1
get	1
a	1
wine	1
like	1
our	1
Heidsieck	1
under	1
twenty	1
shillin’	1
a	1
bottle	1
anywhere	1
in	1
London;”	1
and,	1
dropping	1
his	1
voice,	1
he	1
added:	1
“There’s	1
only	1
five	1
hundred	1
dozen	1
left.	1
I	1
drink	1
it	1
every	1
night	1
of	1
my	1
life.”	1
“I’ll	1
think	1
of	1
it,”	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
would	1
answer;	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
did	1
think	1
of	1
it	1
there	1
was	1
always	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
fifty	1
guineas	1
entrance	1
fee,	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
take	1
him	1
four	1
or	1
five	1
years	1
to	1
get	1
in.	1
He	1
continued	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
it.	1
He	1
was	1
too	1
old	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
Liberal,	1
had	1
long	1
ceased	1
to	1
believe	1
in	1
the	1
political	1
doctrines	1
of	1
his	1
Club,	1
had	1
even	1
been	1
known	1
to	1
allude	1
to	1
them	1
as	1
‘wretched	1
stuff,’	1
and	1
it	1
afforded	1
him	1
pleasure	1
to	1
continue	1
a	1
member	1
in	1
the	1
teeth	1
of	1
principles	1
so	1
opposed	1
to	1
his	1
own.	1
He	1
had	1
always	1
had	1
a	1
contempt	1
for	1
the	1
place,	1
having	1
joined	1
it	1
many	1
years	1
ago	1
when	1
they	1
refused	1
to	1
have	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
‘Hotch	1
Potch’	1
owing	1
to	1
his	1
being	1
‘in	1
trade.’	1
As	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
not	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
any	1
of	1
them!	1
He	1
naturally	1
despised	1
the	1
Club	1
that	1
did	1
take	1
him.	1
The	1
members	1
were	1
a	1
poor	1
lot,	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
City	1
—	1
stockbrokers,	1
solicitors,	1
auctioneers	1
—	1
what	1
not!	1
Like	1
most	1
men	1
of	1
strong	1
character	1
but	1
not	1
too	1
much	1
originality,	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
set	1
small	1
store	1
by	1
the	1
class	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
belonged.	1
Faithfully	1
he	1
followed	1
their	1
customs,	1
social	1
and	1
otherwise,	1
and	1
secretly	1
he	1
thought	1
them	1
‘a	1
common	1
lot.’	1
Years	1
and	1
philosophy,	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
his	1
share,	1
had	1
dimmed	1
the	1
recollection	1
of	1
his	1
defeat	1
at	1
the	1
‘Hotch	1
Potch’;	1
and	1
now	1
in	1
his	1
thoughts	1
it	1
was	1
enshrined	1
as	1
the	1
Queen	1
of	1
Clubs.	1
He	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
member	1
all	1
these	1
years	1
himself,	1
but,	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
slipshod	1
way	1
his	1
proposer,	1
Jack	1
Herring,	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
work,	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
known	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
doing	1
in	1
keeping	1
him	1
out.	1
Why!	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
his	1
son	1
Jo	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
he	1
believed	1
the	1
boy	1
was	1
still	1
a	1
member;	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
a	1
letter	1
dated	1
from	1
there	1
eight	1
years	1
ago.	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
near	1
the	1
‘Disunion’	1
for	1
months,	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
had	1
undergone	1
the	1
piebald	1
decoration	1
which	1
people	1
bestow	1
on	1
old	1
houses	1
and	1
old	1
ships	1
when	1
anxious	1
to	1
sell	1
them.	1
‘Beastly	1
colour,	1
the	1
smoking-room!’	1
he	1
thought.	1
‘The	1
dining-room	1
is	1
good!’	1
Its	1
gloomy	1
chocolate,	1
picked	1
out	1
with	1
light	1
green,	1
took	1
his	1
fancy.	1
He	1
ordered	1
dinner,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
corner,	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
table	1
perhaps!	1
(things	1
did	1
not	1
progress	1
much	1
at	1
the	1
‘Disunion,’	1
a	1
Club	1
of	1
almost	1
Radical	1
principles)	1
at	1
which	1
he	1
and	1
young	1
Jolyon	1
used	1
to	1
sit	1
twenty-five	1
years	1
ago,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
taking	1
the	1
latter	1
to	1
Drury	1
Lane,	1
during	1
his	1
holidays.	1
The	1
boy	1
had	1
loved	1
the	1
theatre,	1
and	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
recalled	1
how	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
sit	1
opposite,	1
concealing	1
his	1
excitement	1
under	1
a	1
careful	1
but	1
transparent	1
nonchalance.	1
He	1
ordered	1
himself,	1
too,	1
the	1
very	1
dinner	1
the	1
boy	1
had	1
always	1
chosen-soup,	1
whitebait,	1
cutlets,	1
and	1
a	1
tart.	1
Ah!	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
only	1
opposite	1
now!	1
The	1
two	1
had	1
not	1
met	1
for	1
fourteen	1
years.	1
And	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
during	1
those	1
fourteen	1
years	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
wondered	1
whether	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
little	1
to	1
blame	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1
of	1
his	1
son.	1
An	1
unfortunate	1
love-affair	1
with	1
that	1
precious	1
flirt	1
Danae	1
Thornworthy	1
(now	1
Danae	1
Pellew),	1
Anthony	1
Thornworthy’s	1
daughter,	1
had	1
thrown	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
rebound	1
into	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
June’s	1
mother.	1
He	1
ought	1
perhaps	1
to	1
have	1
put	1
a	1
spoke	1
in	1
the	1
wheel	1
of	1
their	1
marriage;	1
they	1
were	1
too	1
young;	1
but	1
after	1
that	1
experience	1
of	1
Jo’s	1
susceptibility	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
only	1
too	1
anxious	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
married.	1
And	1
in	1
four	1
years	1
the	1
crash	1
had	1
come!	1
To	1
have	1
approved	1
his	1
son’s	1
conduct	1
in	1
that	1
crash	1
was,	1
of	1
course,	1
impossible;	1
reason	1
and	1
training	1
—	1
that	1
combination	1
of	1
potent	1
factors	1
which	1
stood	1
for	1
his	1
principles	1
—	1
told	1
him	1
of	1
this	1
impossibility,	1
and	1
his	1
heart	1
cried	1
out.	1
The	1
grim	1
remorselessness	1
of	1
that	1
business	1
had	1
no	1
pity	1
for	1
hearts.	1
There	1
was	1
June,	1
the	1
atom	1
with	1
flaming	1
hair,	1
who	1
had	1
climbed	1
all	1
over	1
him,	1
twined	1
and	1
twisted	1
herself	1
about	1
him	1
—	1
about	1
his	1
heart	1
that	1
was	1
made	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
plaything	1
and	1
beloved	1
resort	1
of	1
tiny,	1
helpless	1
things.	1
With	1
characteristic	1
insight	1
he	1
saw	1
he	1
must	1
part	1
with	1
one	1
or	1
with	1
the	1
other;	1
no	1
half-measures	1
could	1
serve	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
situation.	1
In	1
that	1
lay	1
its	1
tragedy.	1
And	1
the	1
tiny,	1
helpless	1
thing	1
prevailed.	1
He	1
would	1
not	1
run	1
with	1
the	1
hare	1
and	1
hunt	1
with	1
the	1
hounds,	1
and	1
so	1
to	1
his	1
son	1
he	1
said	1
good-bye.	1
That	1
good-bye	1
had	1
lasted	1
until	1
now.	1
He	1
had	1
proposed	1
to	1
continue	1
a	1
reduced	1
allowance	1
to	1
young	1
Jolyon,	1
but	1
this	1
had	1
been	1
refused,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
that	1
refusal	1
had	1
hurt	1
him	1
more	1
than	1
anything,	1
for	1
with	1
it	1
had	1
gone	1
the	1
last	1
outlet	1
of	1
his	1
penned-in	1
affection;	1
and	1
there	1
had	1
come	1
such	1
tangible	1
and	1
solid	1
proof	1
of	1
rupture	1
as	1
only	1
a	1
transaction	1
in	1
property,	1
a	1
bestowal	1
or	1
refusal	1
of	1
such,	1
could	1
supply.	1
His	1
dinner	1
tasted	1
flat.	1
His	1
pint	1
of	1
champagne	1
was	1
dry	1
and	1
bitter	1
stuff,	1
not	1
like	1
the	1
Veuve	1
Clicquots	1
of	1
old	1
days.	1
Over	1
his	1
cup	1
of	1
coffee,	1
he	1
bethought	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
opera.	1
In	1
the	1
Times,	1
therefore	1
—	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
distrust	1
of	1
other	1
papers	1
—	1
he	1
read	1
the	1
announcement	1
for	1
the	1
evening.	1
It	1
was	1
‘Fidelio.’	1
Mercifully	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
new-fangled	1
German	1
pantomimes	1
by	1
that	1
fellow	1
Wagner.	1
Putting	1
on	1
his	1
ancient	1
opera	1
hat,	1
which,	1
with	1
its	1
brim	1
flattened	1
by	1
use,	1
and	1
huge	1
capacity,	1
looked	1
like	1
an	1
emblem	1
of	1
greater	1
days,	1
and,	1
pulling	1
out	1
an	1
old	1
pair	1
of	1
very	1
thin	1
lavender	1
kid	1
gloves	1
smelling	1
strongly	1
of	1
Russia	1
leather,	1
from	1
habitual	1
proximity	1
to	1
the	1
cigar-case	1
in	1
the	1
pocket	1
of	1
his	1
overcoat,	1
he	1
stepped	1
into	1
a	1
hansom.	1
The	1
cab	1
rattled	1
gaily	1
along	1
the	1
streets,	1
and	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
their	1
unwonted	1
animation.	1
‘The	1
hotels	1
must	1
be	1
doing	1
a	1
tremendous	1
business,’	1
he	1
thought.	1
A	1
few	1
years	1
ago	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
none	1
of	1
these	1
big	1
hotels.	1
He	1
made	1
a	1
satisfactory	1
reflection	1
on	1
some	1
property	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
going	1
up	1
in	1
value	1
by	1
leaps	1
and	1
bounds!	1
What	1
traffic!	1
But	1
from	1
that	1
he	1
began	1
indulging	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
strange	1
impersonal	1
speculations,	1
so	1
uncharacteristic	1
of	1
a	1
Forsyte,	1
wherein	1
lay,	1
in	1
part,	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
his	1
supremacy	1
amongst	1
them.	1
What	1
atoms	1
men	1
were,	1
and	1
what	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
them!	1
And	1
what	1
would	1
become	1
of	1
them	1
all?	1
He	1
stumbled	1
as	1
he	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cab,	1
gave	1
the	1
man	1
his	1
exact	1
fare,	1
walked	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
ticket	1
office	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
stall,	1
and	1
stood	1
there	1
with	1
his	1
purse	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
—	1
he	1
always	1
carried	1
his	1
money	1
in	1
a	1
purse,	1
never	1
having	1
approved	1
of	1
that	1
habit	1
of	1
carrying	1
it	1
loosely	1
in	1
the	1
pockets,	1
as	1
so	1
many	1
young	1
men	1
did	1
nowadays.	1
The	1
official	1
leaned	1
out,	1
like	1
an	1
old	1
dog	1
from	1
a	1
kennel.	1
“Why,”	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
surprised	1
voice,	1
“it’s	1
Mr.	1
Jolyon	1
Forsyte!	1
So	1
it	1
is!	1
Haven’t	1
seen	1
you,	1
sir,	1
for	1
years.	1
Dear	1
me!	1
Times	1
aren’t	1
what	1
they	1
were.	1
Why!	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
brother,	1
and	1
that	1
auctioneer	1
—	1
Mr.	1
Traquair,	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Nicholas	1
Treffry	1
—	1
you	1
used	1
to	1
have	1
six	1
or	1
seven	1
stalls	1
here	1
regular	1
every	1
season.	1
And	1
how	1
are	1
you,	1
sir?	1
We	1
don’t	1
get	1
younger!”	1
The	1
colour	1
in	1
old	1
Jolyon’s	1
eyes	1
deepened;	1
he	1
paid	1
his	1
guinea.	1
They	1
had	1
not	1
forgotten	1
him.	1
He	1
marched	1
in,	1
to	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
the	1
overture,	1
like	1
an	1
old	1
war-horse	1
to	1
battle.	1
Folding	1
his	1
opera	1
hat,	1
he	1
sat	1
down,	1
drew	1
out	1
his	1
lavender	1
gloves	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
way,	1
and	1
took	1
up	1
his	1
glasses	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
look	1
round	1
the	1
house.	1
Dropping	1
them	1
at	1
last	1
on	1
his	1
folded	1
hat,	1
he	1
fixed	1
his	1
eyes	1
on	1
the	1
curtain.	1
More	1
poignantly	1
than	1
ever	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
over	1
and	1
done	1
with	1
him.	1
Where	1
were	1
all	1
the	1
women,	1
the	1
pretty	1
women,	1
the	1
house	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
full	1
of?	1
Where	1
was	1
that	1
old	1
feeling	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
as	1
he	1
waited	1
for	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
great	1
singers?	1
Where	1
that	1
sensation	1
of	1
the	1
intoxication	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
power	1
to	1
enjoy	1
it	1
all?	1
The	1
greatest	1
opera-goer	1
of	1
his	1
day!	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
opera	1
now!	1
That	1
fellow	1
Wagner	1
had	1
ruined	1
everything;	1
no	1
melody	1
left,	1
nor	1
any	1
voices	1
to	1
sing	1
it.	1
Ah!	1
the	1
wonderful	1
singers!	1
Gone!	1
He	1
sat	1
watching	1
the	1
old	1
scenes	1
acted,	1
a	1
numb	1
feeling	1
at	1
his	1
heart.	1
From	1
the	1
curl	1
of	1
silver	1
over	1
his	1
ear	1
to	1
the	1
pose	1
of	1
his	1
foot	1
in	1
its	1
elastic-sided	1
patent	1
boot,	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
clumsy	1
or	1
weak	1
about	1
old	1
Jolyon.	1
He	1
was	1
as	1
upright	1
—	1
very	1
nearly	1
—	1
as	1
in	1
those	1
old	1
times	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
every	1
night;	1
his	1
sight	1
was	1
as	1
good	1
—	1
almost	1
as	1
good.	1
But	1
what	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
weariness	1
and	1
disillusion!	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
all	1
his	1
life	1
of	1
enjoying	1
things,	1
even	1
imperfect	1
things	1
—	1
and	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
many	1
imperfect	1
things	1
—	1
he	1
had	1
enjoyed	1
them	1
all	1
with	1
moderation,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
keep	1
himself	1
young.	1
But	1
now	1
he	1
was	1
deserted	1
by	1
his	1
power	1
of	1
enjoyment,	1
by	1
his	1
philosophy,	1
and	1
left	1
with	1
this	1
dreadful	1
feeling	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
done	1
with.	1
Not	1
even	1
the	1
Prisoners’	1
Chorus,	1
nor	1
Florian’s	1
Song,	1
had	1
the	1
power	1
to	1
dispel	1
the	1
gloom	1
of	1
his	1
loneliness.	1
If	1
Jo	1
were	1
only	1
with	1
him!	1
The	1
boy	1
must	1
be	1
forty	1
by	1
now.	1
He	1
had	1
wasted	1
fourteen	1
years	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
his	1
only	1
son.	1
And	1
Jo	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
a	1
social	1
pariah.	1
He	1
was	1
married.	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
had	1
been	1
unable	1
to	1
refrain	1
from	1
marking	1
his	1
appreciation	1
of	1
the	1
action	1
by	1
enclosing	1
his	1
son	1
a	1
cheque	1
for	1
L500.	1
The	1
cheque	1
had	1
been	1
returned	1
in	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
the	1
‘Hotch	1
Potch,’	1
couched	1
in	1
these	1
words.	1
‘MY	1
DEAREST	1
FATHER,	1
‘Your	1
generous	1
gift	1
was	1
welcome	1
as	1
a	1
sign	1
that	1
you	1
might	1
think	1
worse	1
of	1
me.	1
I	1
return	1
it,	1
but	1
should	1
you	1
think	1
fit	1
to	1
invest	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
benefit	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
chap	1
(we	1
call	1
him	1
Jolly),	1
who	1
bears	1
our	1
Christian	1
and,	1
by	1
courtesy,	1
our	1
surname,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
very	1
glad.	1
‘I	1
hope	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart	1
that	1
your	1
health	1
is	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
ever.	1
‘Your	1
loving	1
son,	1
‘Jo.’	1
The	1
letter	1
was	1
like	1
the	1
boy.	1
He	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
an	1
amiable	1
chap.	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
had	1
sent	1
this	1
reply:	1
‘MY	1
DEAR	1
JO,	1
‘The	1
sum	1
(L500)	1
stands	1
in	1
my	1
books	1
for	1
the	1
benefit	1
of	1
your	1
boy,	1
under	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Jolyon	1
Forsyte,	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
duly-credited	1
with	1
interest	1
at	1
5	1
per	1
cent.	1
I	1
hope	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
doing	1
well.	1
My	1
health	1
remains	1
good	1
at	1
present.	1
‘With	1
love,	1
I	1
am,	1
‘Your	1
affectionate	1
Father,	1
‘JOLYON	1
FORSYTE.’	1
And	1
every	1
year	1
on	1
the	1
1st	1
of	1
January	1
he	1
had	1
added	1
a	1
hundred	1
and	1
the	1
interest.	1
The	1
sum	1
was	1
mounting	1
up	1
—	1
next	1
New	1
Year’s	1
Day	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
fifteen	1
hundred	1
and	1
odd	1
pounds!	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
difficult	1
to	1
say	1
how	1
much	1
satisfaction	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
yearly	1
transaction.	1
But	1
the	1
correspondence	1
had	1
ended.	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
love	1
for	1
his	1
son,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
an	1
instinct,	1
partly	1
constitutional,	1
partly	1
the	1
result,	1
as	1
in	1
thousands	1
of	1
his	1
class,	1
of	1
the	1
continual	1
handling	1
and	1
watching	1
of	1
affairs,	1
prompting	1
him	1
to	1
judge	1
conduct	1
by	1
results	1
rather	1
than	1
by	1
principle,	1
there	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
uneasiness.	1
His	1
son	1
ought,	1
under	1
the	1
circumstances,	1
to	1
have	1
gone	1
to	1
the	1
dogs;	1
that	1
law	1
was	1
laid	1
down	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
novels,	1
sermons,	1
and	1
plays	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
read,	1
heard,	1
or	1
witnessed.	1
After	1
receiving	1
the	1
cheque	1
back	1
there	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
something	1
wrong	1
somewhere.	1
Why	1
had	1
his	1
son	1
not	1
gone	1
to	1
the	1
dogs?	1
But,	1
then,	1
who	1
could	1
tell?	1
He	1
had	1
heard,	1
of	1
course	1
—	1
in	1
fact,	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
it	1
his	1
business	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
—	1
that	1
Jo	1
lived	1
in	1
St.	1
John’s	1
Wood,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
little	1
house	1
in	1
Wistaria	1
Avenue	1
with	1
a	1
garden,	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
wife	1
about	1
with	1
him	1
into	1
society	1
—	1
a	1
queer	1
sort	1
of	1
society,	1
no	1
doubt	1
—	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
two	1
children	1
—	1
the	1
little	1
chap	1
they	1
called	1
Jolly	1
(considering	1
the	1
circumstances	1
the	1
name	1
struck	1
him	1
as	1
cynical,	1
and	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
both	1
feared	1
and	1
disliked	1
cynicism),	1
and	1
a	1
girl	1
called	1
Holly,	1
born	1
since	1
the	1
marriage.	1
Who	1
could	1
tell	1
what	1
his	1
son’s	1
circumstances	1
really	1
were?	1
He	1
had	1
capitalized	1
the	1
income	1
he	1
had	1
inherited	1
from	1
his	1
mother’s	1
father	1
and	1
joined	1
Lloyd’s	1
as	1
an	1
underwriter;	1
he	1
painted	1
pictures,	1
too	1
—	1
water-colours.	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
knew	1
this,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
surreptitiously	1
bought	1
them	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time,	1
after	1
chancing	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
son’s	1
name	1
signed	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
a	1
representation	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
Thames	1
in	1
a	1
dealer’s	1
window.	1
He	1
thought	1
them	1
bad,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
hang	1
them	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
signature;	1
he	1
kept	1
them	1
locked	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
drawer.	1
In	1
the	1
great	1
opera-house	1
a	1
terrible	1
yearning	1
came	1
on	1
him	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
son.	1
He	1
remembered	1
the	1
days	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
wont	1
to	1
slide	1
him,	1
in	1
a	1
brown	1
holland	1
suit,	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
under	1
the	1
arch	1
of	1
his	1
legs;	1
the	1
times	1
when	1
he	1
ran	1
beside	1
the	1
boy’s	1
pony,	1
teaching	1
him	1
to	1
ride;	1
the	1
day	1
he	1
first	1
took	1
him	1
to	1
school.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
loving,	1
lovable	1
little	1
chap!	1
After	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
Eton	1
he	1
had	1
acquired,	1
perhaps,	1
a	1
little	1
too	1
much	1
of	1
that	1
desirable	1
manner	1
which	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
knew	1
was	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
obtained	1
at	1
such	1
places	1
and	1
at	1
great	1
expense;	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
companionable.	1
Always	1
a	1
companion,	1
even	1
after	1
Cambridge	1
—	1
a	1
little	1
far	1
off,	1
perhaps,	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
advantages	1
he	1
had	1
received.	1
Old	1
Jolyon’s	1
feeling	1
towards	1
our	1
public	1
schools	1
and	1
‘Varsities	1
never	1
wavered,	1
and	1
he	1
retained	1
touchingly	1
his	1
attitude	1
of	1
admiration	1
and	1
mistrust	1
towards	1
a	1
system	1
appropriate	1
to	1
the	1
highest	1
in	1
the	1
land,	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
himself	1
been	1
privileged	1
to	1
partake.	1
.	3
Now	1
that	1
June	1
had	1
gone	1
and	1
left,	1
or	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
left	1
him,	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
comfort	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
son	1
again.	1
Guilty	1
of	1
this	1
treason	1
to	1
his	1
family,	1
his	1
principles,	1
his	1
class,	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
fixed	1
his	1
eyes	1
on	1
the	1
singer.	1
A	1
poor	1
thing	1
—	1
a	1
wretched	1
poor	1
thing!	1
And	1
the	1
Florian	1
a	1
perfect	1
stick!	1
It	1
was	1
over.	1
They	1
were	1
easily	1
pleased	1
nowadays!	1
In	1
the	1
crowded	1
street	1
he	1
snapped	1
up	1
a	1
cab	1
under	1
the	1
very	1
nose	1
of	1
a	1
stout	1
and	1
much	1
younger	1
gentleman,	1
who	1
had	1
already	1
assumed	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
own.	1
His	1
route	1
lay	1
through	1
Pall	1
Mall,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
corner,	1
instead	1
of	1
going	1
through	1
the	1
Green	1
Park,	1
the	1
cabman	1
turned	1
to	1
drive	1
up	1
St.	1
James’s	1
Street.	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
through	1
the	1
trap	1
(he	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
being	1
taken	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
way);	1
in	1
turning,	1
however,	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
opposite	1
the	1
‘Hotch	1
Potch,’	1
and	1
the	1
yearning	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
secretly	1
with	1
him	1
the	1
whole	1
evening	1
prevailed.	1
He	1
called	1
to	1
the	1
driver	1
to	1
stop.	1
He	1
would	1
go	1
in	1
and	1
ask	1
if	1
Jo	1
still	1
belonged	1
there.	1
He	1
went	1
in.	1
The	1
hall	1
looked	1
exactly	1
as	1
it	1
did	1
when	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
dine	1
there	1
with	1
Jack	1
Herring,	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
the	1
best	1
cook	1
in	1
London;	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
round	1
with	1
the	1
shrewd,	1
straight	1
glance	1
that	1
had	1
caused	1
him	1
all	1
his	1
life	1
to	1
be	1
better	1
served	1
than	1
most	1
men.	1
“Mr.	1
Jolyon	1
Forsyte	1
still	1
a	1
member	1
here?”	1
“Yes,	1
sir;	1
in	1
the	1
Club	1
now,	1
sir.	1
What	1
name?”	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
was	1
taken	1
aback.	1
“His	1
father,”	1
he	1
said.	1
And	1
having	1
spoken,	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
stand,	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
fireplace.	1
Young	1
Jolyon,	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
leaving	1
the	1
Club,	1
had	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
hat,	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
crossing	1
the	1
hall,	1
as	1
the	1
porter	1
met	1
him.	1
He	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
young,	1
with	1
hair	1
going	1
grey,	1
and	1
face	1
—	1
a	1
narrower	1
replica	1
of	1
his	1
father’s,	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
large	1
drooping	1
moustache	1
—	1
decidedly	1
worn.	1
He	1
turned	1
pale.	1
This	1
meeting	1
was	1
terrible	1
after	1
all	1
those	1
years,	1
for	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
was	1
so	1
terrible	1
as	1
a	1
scene.	1
They	1
met	1
and	1
crossed	1
hands	1
without	1
a	1
word.	1
Then,	1
with	1
a	1
quaver	1
in	1
his	1
voice,	1
the	1
father	1
said:	1
“How	1
are	1
you,	1
my	1
boy?”	1
The	1
son	1
answered:	1
“How	1
are	1
you,	1
Dad?”	1
Old	1
Jolyon’s	1
hand	1
trembled	1
in	1
its	1
thin	1
lavender	1
glove.	1
“If	1
you’re	1
going	1
my	1
way,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“I	1
can	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
lift.”	1
And	1
as	1
though	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
taking	1
each	1
other	1
home	1
every	1
night	1
they	1
went	1
out	1
and	1
stepped	1
into	1
the	1
cab.	1
To	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
it	1
seemed	1
that	1
his	1
son	1
had	1
grown.	1
‘More	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
altogether,’	1
was	1
his	1
comment.	1
Over	1
the	1
natural	1
amiability	1
of	1
that	1
son’s	1
face	1
had	1
come	1
a	1
rather	1
sardonic	1
mask,	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
circumstances	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
the	1
necessity	1
for	1
armour.	1
The	1
features	1
were	1
certainly	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
Forsyte,	1
but	1
the	1
expression	1
was	1
more	1
the	1
introspective	1
look	1
of	1
a	1
student	1
or	1
philosopher.	1
He	1
had	1
no	1
doubt	1
been	1
obliged	1
to	1
look	1
into	1
himself	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
those	1
fifteen	1
years.	1
To	1
young	1
Jolyon	1
the	1
first	1
sight	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
was	1
undoubtedly	1
a	1
shock	1
—	1
he	1
looked	1
so	1
worn	1
and	1
old.	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
cab	1
he	1
seemed	1
hardly	1
to	1
have	1
changed,	1
still	1
having	1
the	1
calm	1
look	1
so	1
well	1
remembered,	1
still	1
being	1
upright	1
and	1
keen-eyed.	1
“You	1
look	1
well,	1
Dad.”	1
“Middling,”	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
answered.	1
He	1
was	1
the	1
prey	1
of	1
an	1
anxiety	1
that	1
he	1
found	1
he	1
must	1
put	1
into	1
words.	1
Having	1
got	1
his	1
son	1
back	1
like	1
this,	1
he	1
felt	1
he	1
must	1
know	1
what	1
was	1
his	1
financial	1
position.	1
“Jo,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
hear	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
water	1
you’re	1
in.	1
I	1
suppose	1
you’re	1
in	1
debt?”	1
He	1
put	1
it	1
this	1
way	1
that	1
his	1
son	1
might	1
find	1
it	1
easier	1
to	1
confess.	1
Young	1
Jolyon	1
answered	1
in	1
his	1
ironical	1
voice:	1
“No!	1
I’m	1
not	1
in	1
debt!”	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
angry,	1
and	1
touched	1
his	1
hand.	1
He	1
had	1
run	1
a	1
risk.	1
It	1
was	1
worth	1
it,	1
however,	1
and	1
Jo	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
sulky	1
with	1
him.	1
They	1
drove	1
on,	1
without	1
speaking	1
again,	1
to	1
Stanhope	1
Gate.	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
invited	1
him	1
in,	1
but	1
young	1
Jolyon	1
shook	1
his	1
head.	1
“June’s	1
not	1
here,”	1
said	1
his	1
father	1
hastily:	1
“went	1
of	1
to-day	1
on	1
a	1
visit.	1
I	1
suppose	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
she’s	1
engaged	1
to	1
be	1
married?”	1
“Already?”	1
murmured	1
young	1
Jolyon’.	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
stepped	1
out,	1
and,	1
in	1
paying	1
the	1
cab	1
fare,	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
in	1
his	1
life	1
gave	1
the	1
driver	1
a	1
sovereign	1
in	1
mistake	1
for	1
a	1
shilling.	1
Placing	1
the	1
coin	1
in	1
his	1
mouth,	1
the	1
cabman	1
whipped	1
his	1
horse	1
secretly	1
on	1
the	1
underneath	1
and	1
hurried	1
away.	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
turned	1
the	1
key	1
softly	1
in	1
the	1
lock,	1
pushed	1
open	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
beckoned.	1
His	1
son	1
saw	1
him	1
gravely	1
hanging	1
up	1
his	1
coat,	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
boy	1
who	1
intends	1
to	1
steal	1
cherries.	1
The	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
dining-room	1
was	1
open,	1
the	1
gas	1
turned	1
low;	1
a	1
spirit-urn	1
hissed	1
on	1
a	1
tea-tray,	1
and	1
close	1
to	1
it	1
a	1
cynical	1
looking	1
cat	1
had	1
fallen	1
asleep	1
on	1
the	1
dining-table.	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
‘shoo’d’	1
her	1
off	1
at	1
once.	1
The	1
incident	1
was	1
a	1
relief	1
to	1
his	1
feelings;	1
he	1
rattled	1
his	1
opera	1
hat	1
behind	1
the	1
animal.	1
“She’s	1
got	1
fleas,”	1
he	1
said,	1
following	1
her	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
Through	1
the	1
door	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
leading	1
to	1
the	1
basement	1
he	1
called	1
“Hssst!”	1
several	1
times,	1
as	1
though	1
assisting	1
the	1
cat’s	1
departure,	1
till	1
by	1
some	1
strange	1
coincidence	1
the	1
butler	1
appeared	1
below.	1
“You	1
can	1
go	1
to	1
bed,	1
Parfitt,”	1
said	1
old	1
Jolyon.	1
“I	1
will	1
lock	1
up	1
and	1
put	1
out.”	1
When	1
he	1
again	1
entered	1
the	1
dining-room	1
the	1
cat	1
unfortunately	1
preceded	1
him,	1
with	1
her	1
tail	1
in	1
the	1
air,	1
proclaiming	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
through	1
this	1
manouevre	1
for	1
suppressing	1
the	1
butler	1
from	1
the	1
first.	1
.	3
A	1
fatality	1
had	1
dogged	1
old	1
Jolyon’s	1
domestic	1
stratagems	1
all	1
his	1
life.	1
Young	1
Jolyon	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
smiling.	1
He	1
was	1
very	1
well	1
versed	1
in	1
irony,	1
and	1
everything	1
that	1
evening	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
ironical.	1
The	1
episode	1
of	1
the	1
cat;	1
the	1
announcement	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
daughter’s	1
engagement.	1
So	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
more	1
part	1
or	1
parcel	1
in	1
her	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
the	1
Puss!	1
And	1
the	1
poetical	1
justice	1
of	1
this	1
appealed	1
to	1
him.	1
“What	1
is	1
June	1
like	1
now?”	1
he	1
asked.	1
“She’s	1
a	1
little	1
thing,”	1
returned	1
old	1
Jolyon;	1
they	1
say	1
she’s	1
like	1
me,	1
but	1
that’s	1
their	1
folly.	1
She’s	1
more	1
like	1
your	1
mother	1
—	1
the	1
same	1
eyes	1
and	1
hair.”	1
“Ah!	1
and	1
she	1
is	1
pretty?”	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
was	1
too	1
much	1
of	1
a	1
Forsyte	1
to	1
praise	1
anything	1
freely;	1
especially	1
anything	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
genuine	1
admiration.	1
“Not	1
bad	1
looking	1
—	1
a	1
regular	1
Forsyte	1
chin.	1
It’ll	1
be	1
lonely	1
here	1
when	1
she’s	1
gone,	1
Jo.”	1
The	1
look	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
again	1
gave	1
young	1
Jolyon	1
the	1
shock	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
on	1
first	1
seeing	1
his	1
father.	1
“What	1
will	1
you	1
do	1
with	1
yourself,	1
Dad?	1
I	1
suppose	1
she’s	1
wrapped	1
up	1
in	1
him?”	1
“Do	1
with	1
myself?”	1
repeated	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
with	1
an	1
angry	1
break	1
in	1
his	1
voice.	1
“It’ll	1
be	1
miserable	1
work	1
living	1
here	1
alone.	1
I	1
don’t	1
know	1
how	1
it’s	1
to	1
end.	1
I	1
wish	1
to	1
goodness.	1
.	3
”	1
He	1
checked	1
himself,	1
and	1
added:	1
“The	1
question	1
is,	1
what	1
had	1
I	1
better	1
do	1
with	1
this	1
house?”	1
Young	1
Jolyon	1
looked	1
round	1
the	1
room.	1
It	1
was	1
peculiarly	1
vast	1
and	1
dreary,	1
decorated	1
with	1
the	1
enormous	1
pictures	1
of	1
still	1
life	1
that	1
he	1
remembered	1
as	1
a	1
boy	1
—	1
sleeping	1
dogs	1
with	1
their	1
noses	1
resting	1
on	1
bunches	1
of	1
carrots,	1
together	1
with	1
onions	1
and	1
grapes	1
lying	1
side	1
by	1
side	1
in	1
mild	1
surprise.	1
The	1
house	1
was	1
a	1
white	1
elephant,	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
conceive	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
living	1
in	1
a	1
smaller	1
place;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
did	1
it	1
all	1
seem	1
ironical.	1
In	1
his	1
great	1
chair	1
with	1
the	1
book-rest	1
sat	1
old	1
Jolyon,	1
the	1
figurehead	1
of	1
his	1
family	1
and	1
class	1
and	1
creed,	1
with	1
his	1
white	1
head	1
and	1
dome-like	1
forehead,	1
the	1
representative	1
of	1
moderation,	1
and	1
order,	1
and	1
love	1
of	1
property.	1
As	1
lonely	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
as	1
there	1
was	1
in	1
London.	1
There	1
he	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
gloomy	1
comfort	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
a	1
puppet	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
great	1
forces	1
that	1
cared	1
nothing	1
for	1
family	1
or	1
class	1
or	1
creed,	1
but	1
moved,	1
machine-like,	1
with	1
dread	1
processes	1
to	1
inscrutable	1
ends.	1
This	1
was	1
how	1
it	1
struck	1
young	1
Jolyon,	1
who	1
had	1
the	1
impersonal	1
eye.	1
The	1
poor	1
old	1
Dad!	1
So	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
end,	1
the	1
purpose	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
lived	1
with	1
such	1
magnificent	1
moderation!	1
To	1
be	1
lonely,	1
and	1
grow	1
older	1
and	1
older,	1
yearning	1
for	1
a	1
soul	1
to	1
speak	1
to!	1
In	1
his	1
turn	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
looked	1
back	1
at	1
his	1
son.	1
He	1
wanted	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
many	1
things	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
unable	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
all	1
these	1
years.	1
It	1
had	1
been	1
impossible	1
to	1
seriously	1
confide	1
in	1
June	1
his	1
conviction	1
that	1
property	1
in	1
the	1
Soho	1
quarter	1
would	1
go	1
up	1
in	1
value;	1
his	1
uneasiness	1
about	1
that	1
tremendous	1
silence	1
of	1
Pippin,	1
the	1
superintendent	1
of	1
the	1
New	1
Colliery	1
Company,	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
long	1
been	1
chairman;	1
his	1
disgust	1
at	1
the	1
steady	1
fall	1
in	1
American	1
Golgothas,	1
or	1
even	1
to	1
discuss	1
how,	1
by	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
settlement,	1
he	1
could	1
best	1
avoid	1
the	1
payment	1
of	1
those	1
death	1
duties	1
which	1
would	1
follow	1
his	1
decease.	1
Under	1
the	1
influence,	1
however,	1
of	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
tea,	1
which	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
stir	1
indefinitely,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
at	1
last.	1
A	1
new	1
vista	1
of	1
life	1
was	1
thus	1
opened	1
up,	1
a	1
promised	1
land	1
of	1
talk,	1
where	1
he	1
could	1
find	1
a	1
harbour	1
against	1
the	1
waves	1
of	1
anticipation	1
and	1
regret;	1
where	1
he	1
could	1
soothe	1
his	1
soul	1
with	1
the	1
opium	1
of	1
devising	1
how	1
to	1
round	1
off	1
his	1
property	1
and	1
make	1
eternal	1
the	1
only	1
part	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
remain	1
alive.	1
Young	1
Jolyon	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
listener;	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
great	1
quality.	1
He	1
kept	1
his	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
his	1
father’s	1
face,	1
putting	1
a	1
question	1
now	1
and	1
then.	1
The	1
clock	1
struck	1
one	1
before	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
had	1
finished,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
its	1
striking	1
his	1
principles	1
came	1
back.	1
He	1
took	1
out	1
his	1
watch	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
surprise:	1
“I	1
must	1
go	1
to	1
bed,	1
Jo,”	1
he	1
said.	1
Young	1
Jolyon	1
rose	1
and	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
help	1
his	1
father	1
up.	1
The	1
old	1
face	1
looked	1
worn	1
and	1
hollow	1
again;	1
the	1
eyes	1
were	1
steadily	1
averted.	1
“Good-bye,	1
my	1
boy;	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
yourself.”	1
A	1
moment	1
passed,	1
and	1
young	1
Jolyon,	1
turning	1
on	1
his,	1
heel,	1
marched	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
door.	1
He	1
could	1
hardly	1
see;	1
his	1
smile	1
quavered.	1
Never	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
fifteen	1
years	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
first	1
found	1
out	1
that	1
life	1
was	1
no	1
simple	1
business,	1
had	1
he	1
found	1
it	1
so	1
singularly	1
complicated.	1
Chapter	1
3	1
In	1
Swithin’s	1
orange	1
and	1
light-blue	1
dining-room,	1
facing	1
the	1
Park,	1
the	1
round	1
table	1
was	1
laid	1
for	1
twelve.	1
A	1
cut-glass	1
chandelier	1
filled	1
with	1
lighted	1
candles	1
hung	1
like	1
a	1
giant	1
stalactite	1
above	1
its	1
centre,	1
radiating	1
over	1
large	1
gilt-framed	1
mirrors,	1
slabs	1
of	1
marble	1
on	1
the	1
tops	1
of	1
side-tables,	1
and	1
heavy	1
gold	1
chairs	1
with	1
crewel	1
worked	1
seats.	1
Everything	1
betokened	1
that	1
love	1
of	1
beauty	1
so	1
deeply	1
implanted	1
in	1
each	1
family	1
which	1
has	1
had	1
its	1
own	1
way	1
to	1
make	1
into	1
Society,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
more	1
vulgar	1
heart	1
of	1
Nature.	1
Swithin	1
had	1
indeed	1
an	1
impatience	1
of	1
simplicity,	1
a	1
love	1
of	1
ormolu,	1
which	1
had	1
always	1
stamped	1
him	1
amongst	1
his	1
associates	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
great,	1
if	1
somewhat	1
luxurious	1
taste;	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
knowledge	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
possibly	1
enter	1
his	1
rooms	1
without	1
perceiving	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
wealth,	1
he	1
had	1
derived	1
a	1
solid	1
and	1
prolonged	1
happiness	1
such	1
as	1
perhaps	1
no	1
other	1
circumstance	1
in	1
life	1
had	1
afforded	1
him.	1
Since	1
his	1
retirement	1
from	1
land	1
agency,	1
a	1
profession	1
deplorable	1
in	1
his	1
estimation,	1
especially	1
as	1
to	1
its	1
auctioneering	1
department,	1
he	1
had	1
abandoned	1
himself	1
to	1
naturally	1
aristocratic	1
tastes.	1
The	1
perfect	1
luxury	1
of	1
his	1
latter	1
days	1
had	1
embedded	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
fly	1
in	1
sugar;	1
and	1
his	1
mind,	1
where	1
very	1
little	1
took	1
place	1
from	1
morning	1
till	1
night,	1
was	1
the	1
junction	1
of	1
two	1
curiously	1
opposite	1
emotions,	1
a	1
lingering	1
and	1
sturdy	1
satisfaction	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
his	1
own	1
way	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
fortune,	1
and	1
a	1
sense	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
his	1
distinction	1
should	1
never	1
have	1
been	1
allowed	1
to	1
soil	1
his	1
mind	1
with	1
work.	1
He	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
sideboard	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
waistcoat	1
with	1
large	1
gold	1
and	1
onyx	1
buttons,	1
watching	1
his	1
valet	1
screw	1
the	1
necks	1
of	1
three	1
champagne	1
bottles	1
deeper	1
into	1
ice-pails.	1
Between	1
the	1
points	1
of	1
his	1
stand-up	1
collar,	1
which	1
—	1
though	1
it	1
hurt	1
him	1
to	1
move	1
—	1
he	1
would	1
on	1
no	1
account	1
have	1
had	1
altered,	1
the	1
pale	1
flesh	1
of	1
his	1
under	1
chin	1
remained	1
immovable.	1
His	1
eyes	1
roved	1
from	1
bottle	1
to	1
bottle.	1
He	1
was	1
debating,	1
and	1
he	1
argued	1
like	1
this:	1
Jolyon	1
drinks	1
a	1
glass,	1
perhaps	1
two,	1
he’s	1
so	1
careful	1
of	1
himself.	1
James,	1
he	1
can’t	1
take	1
his	1
wine	1
nowadays.	1
Nicholas	1
—	1
Fanny	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
swill	1
water	1
he	1
shouldn’t	1
wonder!	1
Soames	1
didn’t	1
count;	1
these	1
young	1
nephews	1
—	1
Soames	1
was	1
thirty-one	1
—	1
couldn’t	1
drink!	1
But	1
Bosinney?	1
Encountering	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
this	1
stranger	1
something	1
outside	1
the	1
range	1
of	1
his	1
philosophy,	1
Swithin	1
paused.	1
A	1
misgiving	1
arose	1
within	1
him!	1
It	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
tell!	1
June	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
girl,	1
in	1
love	1
too!	1
Emily	1
(Mrs.	1
James)	1
liked	1
a	1
good	1
glass	1
of	1
champagne.	1
It	1
was	1
too	1
dry	1
for	1
Juley,	1
poor	1
old	1
soul,	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
palate.	1
As	1
to	1
Hatty	1
Chessman!	1
The	1
thought	1
of	1
this	1
old	1
friend	1
caused	1
a	1
cloud	1
of	1
thought	1
to	1
obscure	1
the	1
perfect	1
glassiness	1
of	1
his	1
eyes:	1
He	1
shouldn’t	1
wonder	1
if	1
she	1
drank	1
half	1
a	1
bottle!	1
But	1
in	1
thinking	1
of	1
his	1
remaining	1
guest,	1
an	1
expression	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
cat	1
who	1
is	1
just	1
going	1
to	1
purr	1
stole	1
over	1
his	1
old	1
face:	1
Mrs.	1
Soames!	1
She	1
mightn’t	1
take	1
much,	1
but	1
she	1
would	1
appreciate	1
what	1
she	1
drank;	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
pleasure	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
good	1
wine!	1
A	1
pretty	1
woman	1
—	1
and	1
sympathetic	1
to	1
him!	1
The	1
thought	1
of	1
her	1
was	1
like	1
champagne	1
itself!	1
A	1
pleasure	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
good	1
wine	1
to	1
a	1
young	1
woman	1
who	1
looked	1
so	1
well,	1
who	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
dress,	1
with	1
charming	1
manners,	1
quite	1
distinguished	1
—	1
a	1
pleasure	1
to	1
entertain	1
her.	1
Between	1
the	1
points	1
of	1
his	1
collar	1
he	1
gave	1
his	1
head	1
the	1
first	1
small,	1
painful	1
oscillation	1
of	1
the	1
evening.	1
“Adolf!”	1
he	1
said.	1
“Put	1
in	1
another	1
bottle.”	1
He	1
himself	1
might	1
drink	1
a	1
good	1
deal,	1
for,	1
thanks	1
to	1
that	1
prescription	1
of	1
Blight’s,	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
extremely	1
well,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
careful	1
to	1
take	1
no	1
lunch.	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
felt	1
so	1
well	1
for	1
weeks.	1
Puffing	1
out	1
his	1
lower	1
lip,	1
he	1
gave	1
his	1
last	1
instructions:	1
“Adolf,	1
the	1
least	1
touch	1
of	1
the	1
West	1
India	1
when	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
ham.”	1
Passing	1
into	1
the	1
anteroom,	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
a	1
chair,	1
with	1
his	1
knees	1
apart;	1
and	1
his	1
tall,	1
bulky	1
form	1
was	1
wrapped	1
at	1
once	1
in	1
an	1
expectant,	1
strange,	1
primeval	1
immobility.	1
He	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
rise	1
at	1
a	1
moment’s	1
notice.	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
given	1
a	1
dinner-party	1
for	1
months.	1
This	1
dinner	1
in	1
honour	1
of	1
June’s	1
engagement	1
had	1
seemed	1
a	1
bore	1
at	1
first	1
(among	1
Forsytes	1
the	1
custom	1
of	1
solemnizing	1
engagements	1
by	1
feasts	1
was	1
religiously	1
observed),	1
but	1
the	1
labours	1
of	1
sending	1
invitations	1
and	1
ordering	1
the	1
repast	1
over,	1
he	1
felt	1
pleasantly	1
stimulated.	1
And	1
thus	1
sitting,	1
a	1
watch	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
fat,	1
and	1
smooth,	1
and	1
golden,	1
like	1
a	1
flattened	1
globe	1
of	1
butter,	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
nothing.	1
A	1
long	1
man,	1
with	1
side	1
whiskers,	1
who	1
had	1
once	1
been	1
in	1
Swithin’s	1
service,	1
but	1
was	1
now	1
a	1
greengrocer,	1
entered	1
and	1
proclaimed:	1
“Mrs.	1
Chessman,	1
Mrs.	1
Septimus	1
Small!”	1
Two	1
ladies	1
advanced.	1
The	1
one	1
in	1
front,	1
habited	1
entirely	1
in	1
red,	1
had	1
large,	1
settled	1
patches	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
colour	1
in	1
her	1
cheeks,	1
and	1
a	1
hard,	1
dashing	1
eye.	1
She	1
walked	1
at	1
Swithin,	1
holding	1
out	1
a	1
hand	1
cased	1
in	1
a	1
long,	1
primrose-coloured	1
glove:	1
“Well!	1
Swithin,”	1
she	1
said,	1
“I	1
haven’t	1
seen	1
you	1
for	1
ages.	1
How	1
are	1
you?	1
Why,	1
my	1
dear	1
boy,	1
how	1
stout	1
you’re	1
getting!”	1
The	1
fixity	1
of	1
Swithin’s	1
eye	1
alone	1
betrayed	1
emotion.	1
A	1
dumb	1
and	1
grumbling	1
anger	1
swelled	1
his	1
bosom.	1
It	1
was	1
vulgar	1
to	1
be	1
stout,	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
being	1
stout;	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
chest,	1
nothing	1
more.	1
Turning	1
to	1
his	1
sister,	1
he	1
grasped	1
her	1
hand,	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
command:	1
“Well,	1
Juley.”	1
Mrs.	1
Septimus	1
Small	1
was	1
the	1
tallest	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
sisters;	1
her	1
good,	1
round	1
old	1
face	1
had	1
gone	1
a	1
little	1
sour;	1
an	1
innumerable	1
pout	1
clung	1
all	1
over	1
it,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
encased	1
in	1
an	1
iron	1
wire	1
mask	1
up	1
to	1
that	1
evening,	1
which,	1
being	1
suddenly	1
removed,	1
left	1
little	1
rolls	1
of	1
mutinous	1
flesh	1
all	1
over	1
her	1
countenance.	1
Even	1
her	1
eyes	1
were	1
pouting.	1
It	1
was	1
thus	1
that	1
she	1
recorded	1
her	1
permanent	1
resentment	1
at	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
Septimus	1
Small.	1
She	1
had	1
quite	1
a	1
reputation	1
for	1
saying	1
the	1
wrong	1
thing,	1
and,	1
tenacious	1
like	1
all	1
her	1
breed,	1
she	1
would	1
hold	1
to	1
it	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
it,	1
and	1
add	1
to	1
it	1
another	1
wrong	1
thing,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
With	1
the	1
decease	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
the	1
family	1
tenacity,	1
the	1
family	1
matter-of-factness,	1
had	1
gone	1
sterile	1
within	1
her.	1
A	1
great	1
talker,	1
when	1
allowed,	1
she	1
would	1
converse	1
without	1
the	1
faintest	1
animation	1
for	1
hours	1
together,	1
relating,	1
with	1
epic	1
monotony,	1
the	1
innumerable	1
occasions	1
on	1
which	1
Fortune	1
had	1
misused	1
her;	1
nor	1
did	1
she	1
ever	1
perceive	1
that	1
her	1
hearers	1
sympathized	1
with	1
Fortune,	1
for	1
her	1
heart	1
was	1
kind.	1
Having	1
sat,	1
poor	1
soul,	1
long	1
by	1
the	1
bedside	1
of	1
Small	1
(a	1
man	1
of	1
poor	1
constitution),	1
she	1
had	1
acquired,	1
the	1
habit,	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
countless	1
subsequent	1
occasions	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
sat	1
immense	1
periods	1
of	1
time	1
to	1
amuse	1
sick	1
people,	1
children,	1
and	1
other	1
helpless	1
persons,	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
never	1
divest	1
herself	1
of	1
the	1
feeling	1
that	1
the	1
world	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
ungrateful	1
place	1
anybody	1
could	1
live	1
in.	1
Sunday	1
after	1
Sunday	1
she	1
sat	1
at	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
that	1
extremely	1
witty	1
preacher,	1
the	1
Rev.	1
Thomas	1
Scoles,	1
who	1
exercised	1
a	1
great	1
influence	1
over	1
her;	1
but	1
she	1
succeeded	1
in	1
convincing	1
everybody	1
that	1
even	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
misfortune.	1
She	1
had	1
passed	1
into	1
a	1
proverb	1
in	1
the	1
family,	1
and	1
when	1
anybody	1
was	1
observed	1
to	1
be	1
peculiarly	1
distressing,	1
he	1
was	1
known	1
as	1
a	1
regular	1
‘Juley.’	1
The	1
habit	1
of	1
her	1
mind	1
would	1
have	1
killed	1
anybody	1
but	1
a	1
Forsyte	1
at	1
forty;	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
seventy-two,	1
and	1
had	1
never	1
looked	1
better.	1
And	1
one	1
felt	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
capacities	1
for	1
enjoyment	1
about	1
her	1
which	1
might	1
yet	1
come	1
out.	1
She	1
owned	1
three	1
canaries,	1
the	1
cat	1
Tommy,	1
and	1
half	1
a	1
parrot	1
—	1
in	1
common	1
with	1
her	1
sister	1
Hester;	1
—	1
and	1
these	1
poor	1
creatures	1
(kept	1
carefully	1
out	1
of	1
Timothy’s	1
way	1
—	1
he	1
was	1
nervous	1
about	1
animals),	1
unlike	1
human	1
beings,	1
recognising	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
being	1
blighted,	1
attached	1
themselves	1
to	1
her	1
passionately.	1
She	1
was	1
sombrely	1
magnificent	1
this	1
evening	1
in	1
black	1
bombazine,	1
with	1
a	1
mauve	1
front	1
cut	1
in	1
a	1
shy	1
triangle,	1
and	1
crowned	1
with	1
a	1
black	1
velvet	1
ribbon	1
round	1
the	1
base	1
of	1
her	1
thin	1
throat;	1
black	1
and	1
mauve	1
for	1
evening	1
wear	1
was	1
esteemed	1
very	1
chaste	1
by	1
nearly	1
every	1
Forsyte.	1
Pouting	1
at	1
Swithin,	1
she	1
said:	1
“Ann	1
has	1
been	1
asking	1
for	1
you.	1
You	1
haven’t	1
been	1
near	1
us	1
for	1
an	1
age!”	1
Swithin	1
put	1
his	1
thumbs	1
within	1
the	1
armholes	1
of	1
his	1
waistcoat,	1
and	1
replied:	1
“Ann’s	1
getting	1
very	1
shaky;	1
she	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
doctor!”	1
“Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Nicholas	1
Forsyte!”	1
Nicholas	1
Forsyte,	1
cocking	1
his	1
rectangular	1
eyebrows,	1
wore	1
a	1
smile.	1
He	1
had	1
succeeded	1
during	1
the	1
day	1
in	1
bringing	1
to	1
fruition	1
a	1
scheme	1
for	1
the	1
employment	1
of	1
a	1
tribe	1
from	1
Upper	1
India	1
in	1
the	1
gold-mines	1
of	1
Ceylon.	1
A	1
pet	1
plan,	1
carried	1
at	1
last	1
in	1
the	1
teeth	1
of	1
great	1
difficulties	1
—	1
he	1
was	1
justly	1
pleased.	1
It	1
would	1
double	1
the	1
output	1
of	1
his	1
mines,	1
and,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
often	1
forcibly	1
argued,	1
all	1
experience	1
tended	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
must	1
die;	1
and	1
whether	1
he	1
died	1
of	1
a	1
miserable	1
old	1
age	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
country,	1
or	1
prematurely	1
of	1
damp	1
in	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
a	1
foreign	1
mine,	1
was	1
surely	1
of	1
little	1
consequence,	1
provided	1
that	1
by	1
a	1
change	1
in	1
his	1
mode	1
of	1
life	1
he	1
benefited	1
the	1
British	1
Empire.	1
His	1
ability	1
was	1
undoubted.	1
Raising	1
his	1
broken	1
nose	1
towards	1
his	1
listener,	1
he	1
would	1
add:	1
“For	1
want	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
hundred	1
of	1
these	1
fellows	1
we	1
haven’t	1
paid	1
a	1
dividend	1
for	1
years,	1
and	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
the	1
shares.	1
I	1
can’t	1
get	1
ten	1
shillings	1
for	1
them.”	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
Yarmouth,	1
too,	1
and	1
had	1
come	1
back	1
feeling	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
added	1
at	1
least	1
ten	1
years	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
life.	1
He	1
grasped	1
Swithin’s	1
hand,	1
exclaiming	1
in	1
a	1
jocular	1
voice:	1
“Well,	1
so	1
here	1
we	1
are	1
again!”	1
Mrs.	1
Nicholas,	1
an	1
effete	1
woman,	1
smiled	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
frightened	1
jollity	1
behind	1
his	1
back.	1
“Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
James	1
Forsyte!	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Soames	1
Forsyte!”	1
Swithin	1
drew	1
his	1
heels	1
together,	1
his	1
deportment	1
ever	1
admirable.	1
“Well,	1
James,	1
well	1
Emily!	1
How	1
are	1
you,	1
Soames?	1
How	1
do	1
you	1
do?”	1
His	1
hand	1
enclosed	1
Irene’s,	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
swelled.	1
She	1
was	1
a	1
pretty	1
woman	1
—	1
a	1
little	1
too	1
pale,	1
but	1
her	1
figure,	1
her	1
eyes,	1
her	1
teeth!	1
Too	1
good	1
for	1
that	1
chap	1
Soames!	1
The	1
gods	1
had	1
given	1
Irene	1
dark	1
brown	1
eyes	1
and	1
golden	1
hair,	1
that	1
strange	1
combination,	1
provocative	1
of	1
men’s	1
glances,	1
which	1
is	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
mark	1
of	1
a	1
weak	1
character.	1
And	1
the	1
full,	1
soft	1
pallor	1
of	1
her	1
neck	1
and	1
shoulders,	1
above	1
a	1
gold-coloured	1
frock,	1
gave	1
to	1
her	1
personality	1
an	1
alluring	1
strangeness.	1
Soames	1
stood	1
behind,	1
his	1
eyes	1
fastened	1
on	1
his	1
wife’s	1
neck.	1
The	1
hands	1
of	1
Swithin’s	1
watch,	1
which	1
he	1
still	1
held	1
open	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
had	1
left	1
eight	1
behind;	1
it	1
was	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
beyond	1
his	1
dinner-time	1
—	1
he	1
had	2
no	1
lunch	1
—	1
and	1
a	1
strange	1
primeval	1
impatience	1
surged	1
up	1
within	1
him.	1
“It’s	1
not	1
like	1
Jolyon	1
to	1
be	1
late!”	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Irene,	1
with	1
uncontrollable	1
vexation.	1
“I	1
suppose	1
it’ll	1
be	1
June	1
keeping	1
him!”	1
“People	1
in	1
love	1
are	1
always	1
late,”	1
she	1
answered.	1
Swithin	1
stared	1
at	1
her;	1
a	1
dusky	1
orange	1
dyed	1
his	1
cheeks.	1
“They’ve	1
no	1
business	1
to	1
be.	1
Some	1
fashionable	1
nonsense!”	1
And	1
behind	1
this	1
outburst	1
the	1
inarticulate	1
violence	1
of	1
primitive	1
generations	1
seemed	1
to	1
mutter	1
and	1
grumble.	1
“Tell	1
me	1
what	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
my	1
new	1
star,	1
Uncle	1
Swithin,”	1
said	1
Irene	1
softly.	1
Among	1
the	1
lace	1
in	1
the	1
bosom	1
of	1
her	1
dress	1
was	1
shining	1
a	1
five-pointed	1
star,	1
made	1
of	1
eleven	1
diamonds.	1
Swithin	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
star.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
pretty	1
taste	1
in	1
stones;	1
no	1
question	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
more	1
sympathetically	1
devised	1
to	1
distract	1
his	1
attention.	1
“Who	1
gave	1
you	1
that?”	1
he	1
asked.	1
“Soames.”	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
change	1
in	1
her	1
face,	1
but	1
Swithin’s	1
pale	1
eyes	1
bulged	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
might	1
suddenly	1
have	1
been	1
afflicted	1
with	1
insight.	1
“I	1
dare	1
say	1
you’re	1
dull	1
at	1
home,”	1
he	1
said.	1
“Any	1
day	1
you	1
like	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
dine	1
with	1
me,	1
I’ll	1
give	1
you	1
as	1
good	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
wine	1
as	1
you’ll	1
get	1
in	1
London.”	1
“Miss	1
June	1
Forsyte	1
—	1
Mr.	1
Jolyon	1
Forsyte!	1
.	3
Mr.	1
Boswainey!	1
.	3
”	1
Swithin	1
moved	1
his	1
arm,	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
rumbling	1
voice:	1
“Dinner,	1
now	1
—	1
dinner!”	1
He	1
took	1
in	1
Irene,	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
entertained	1
her	1
since	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
bride.	1
June	1
was	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
Bosinney,	1
who	1
was	1
placed	1
between	1
Irene	1
and	1
his	1
fiancee.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
June	1
was	1
James	1
with	1
Mrs.	1
Nicholas,	1
then	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
with	1
Mrs.	1
James,	1
Nicholas	1
with	1
Hatty	1
Chessman,	1
Soames	1
with	1
Mrs.	1
Small,	1
completing,	1
the	1
circle	1
to	1
Swithin	1
again.	1
Family	1
dinners	1
of	1
the	1
Forsytes	1
observe	1
certain	1
traditions.	1
There	1
are,	1
for	1
instance,	1
no	1
hors	1
d’oeuvre.	1
The	1
reason	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
unknown.	1
Theory	1
among	1
the	1
younger	1
members	1
traces	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
disgraceful	1
price	1
of	1
oysters;	1
it	1
is	1
more	1
probably	1
due	1
to	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
point,	1
to	1
a	1
good	1
practical	1
sense	1
deciding	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
hors	1
d’oeuvre	1
are	1
but	1
poor	1
things.	1
The	1
Jameses	1
alone,	1
unable	1
to	1
withstand	1
a	1
custom	1
almost	1
universal	1
in	1
Park	1
Lane,	1
are	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
unfaithful.	1
A	1
silent,	1
almost	1
morose,	1
inattention	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
succeeds	1
to	1
the	1
subsidence	1
into	1
their	1
seats,	1
lasting	1
till	1
well	1
into	1
the	1
first	1
entree,	1
but	1
interspersed	1
with	1
remarks	1
such	1
as,	1
“Tom’s	1
bad	1
again;	1
I	1
can’t	1
tell	1
what’s	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
him!”	1
“I	1
suppose	1
Ann	1
doesn’t	1
come	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
mornings?”—“What’s	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
your	1
doctor,	1
Fanny?”	1
“Stubbs?”	1
“He’s	1
a	1
quack!”—“Winifred?	1
She’s	1
got	1
too	1
many	1
children.	1
Four,	1
isn’t	1
it?	1
She’s	1
as	1
thin	1
as	1
a	1
lath!”—“What	1
d’you	1
give	1
for	1
this	1
sherry,	1
Swithin?	1
Too	1
dry	1
for	1
me!”	1
With	1
the	1
second	1
glass	1
of	1
champagne,	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
hum	1
makes	1
itself	1
heard,	1
which,	1
when	1
divested	1
of	1
casual	1
accessories	1
and	1
resolved	1
into	1
its	1
primal	1
element,	1
is	1
found	1
to	1
be	1
James	1
telling	1
a	1
story,	1
and	1
this	1
goes	1
on	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
encroaching	1
sometimes	1
even	1
upon	1
what	1
must	1
universally	1
be	1
recognised	1
as	1
the	1
crowning	1
point	1
of	1
a	1
Forsyte	1
feast	1
—‘the	1
saddle	1
of	1
mutton.’	1
No	1
Forsyte	1
has	1
given	1
a	1
dinner	1
without	1
providing	1
a	1
saddle	1
of	1
mutton.	1
There	1
is	1
something	1
in	1
its	1
succulent	1
solidity	1
which	1
makes	1
it	1
suitable	1
to	1
people	1
‘of	1
a	1
certain	1
position.’	1
It	1
is	1
nourishing	1
and	1
tasty;	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
thing	1
a	1
man	1
remembers	1
eating.	1
It	1
has	1
a	1
past	1
and	1
a	1
future,	1
like	1
a	1
deposit	1
paid	1
into	1
a	1
bank;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
something	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
argued	1
about.	1
Each	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
tenaciously	1
held	1
to	1
a	1
particular	1
locality	1
—	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
swearing	1
by	1
Dartmoor,	1
James	1
by	1
Welsh,	1
Swithin	1
by	1
Southdown,	1
Nicholas	1
maintaining	1
that	1
people	1
might	1
sneer,	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
like	1
New	1
Zealand!	1
As	1
for	1
Roger,	1
the	1
‘original’	1
of	1
the	1
brothers,	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
obliged	1
to	1
invent	1
a	1
locality	1
of	1
his	1
own,	1
and	1
with	1
an	1
ingenuity	1
worthy	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
devised	1
a	1
new	1
profession	1
for	1
his	1
sons,	1
he	1
had	1
discovered	1
a	1
shop	1
where	1
they	1
sold	1
German;	1
on	1
being	1
remonstrated	1
with,	1
he	1
had	1
proved	1
his	1
point	1
by	1
producing	1
a	1
butcher’s	1
bill,	1
which	1
showed	1
that	1
he	1
paid	1
more	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
others.	1
It	1
was	1
on	1
this	1
occasion	1
that	1
old	1
Jolyon,	1
turning	1
to	1
June,	1
had	1
said	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
bursts	1
of	1
philosophy:	1
“You	1
may	1
depend	1
upon	1
it,	1
they’re	1
a	1
cranky	1
lot,	1
the	1
Forsytes	1
—	1
and	1
you’ll	1
find	1
it	1
out,	1
as	1
you	1
grow	1
older!”	1
Timothy	1
alone	1
held	1
apart,	1
for	1
though	1
he	1
ate	1
saddle	1
of	1
mutton	1
heartily,	1
he	1
was,	1
he	1
said,	1
afraid	1
of	1
it.	1
To	1
anyone	1
interested	1
psychologically	1
in	1
Forsytes,	1
this	1
great	1
saddle-of-mutton	1
trait	1
is	1
of	1
prime	1
importance;	1
not	1
only	1
does	1
it	1
illustrate	1
their	1
tenacity,	1
both	1
collectively	1
and	1
as	1
individuals,	1
but	1
it	1
marks	1
them	1
as	1
belonging	1
in	1
fibre	1
and	1
instincts	1
to	1
that	1
great	1
class	1
which	1
believes	1
in	1
nourishment	1
and	1
flavour,	1
and	1
yields	1
to	1
no	1
sentimental	1
craving	1
for	1
beauty.	1
Younger	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
indeed	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
without	1
a	1
joint	1
altogether,	1
preferring	1
guinea-fowl,	1
or	1
lobster	1
salad	1
—	1
something	1
which	1
appealed	1
to	1
the	1
imagination,	1
and	1
had	1
less	1
nourishment	1
—	1
but	1
these	1
were	1
females;	1
or,	1
if	1
not,	1
had	1
been	1
corrupted	1
by	1
their	1
wives,	1
or	1
by	1
mothers,	1
who	1
having	1
been	1
forced	1
to	1
eat	1
saddle	1
of	1
mutton	1
throughout	1
their	1
married	1
lives,	1
had	1
passed	1
a	1
secret	1
hostility	1
towards	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
fibre	1
of	1
their	1
sons.	1
The	1
great	1
saddle-of-mutton	1
controversy	1
at	1
an	1
end,	1
a	1
Tewkesbury	1
ham	1
commenced,	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
least	1
touch	1
of	1
West	1
Indian	1
—	1
Swithin	1
was	1
so	1
long	1
over	1
this	1
course	1
that	1
he	1
caused	1
a	1
block	1
in	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
the	1
dinner.	1
To	1
devote	1
himself	1
to	1
it	1
with	1
better	1
heart,	1
he	1
paused	1
in	1
his	1
conversation.	1
From	1
his	1
seat	1
by	1
Mrs.	1
Septimus	1
Small	1
Soames	1
was	1
watching.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
reason	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
connected	1
with	1
a	1
pet	1
building	1
scheme,	1
for	1
observing	1
Bosinney.	1
The	1
architect	1
might	1
do	1
for	1
his	1
purpose;	1
he	1
looked	1
clever,	1
as	1
he	1
sat	1
leaning	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
chair,	1
moodily	1
making	1
little	1
ramparts	1
with	1
bread-crumbs.	1
Soames	1
noted	1
his	1
dress	1
clothes	1
to	1
be	1
well	1
cut,	1
but	1
too	1
small,	1
as	1
though	1
made	1
many	1
years	1
ago.	1
He	1
saw	1
him	1
turn	1
to	1
Irene	1
and	1
say	1
something	1
and	1
her	1
face	1
sparkle	1
as	1
he	1
often	1
saw	1
it	1
sparkle	1
at	1
other	1
people	1
—	1
never	1
at	1
himself.	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
catch	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
saying,	1
but	1
Aunt	1
Juley	1
was	1
speaking.	1
Hadn’t	1
that	1
always	1
seemed	1
very	1
extraordinary	1
to	1
Soames?	1
Only	1
last	1
Sunday	1
dear	1
Mr.	1
Scole,	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
witty	1
in	1
his	1
sermon,	1
so	1
sarcastic,	1
“For	1
what,”	1
he	1
had	1
said,	1
“shall	1
it	1
profit	1
a	1
man	1
if	1
he	1
gain	1
his	1
own	1
soul,	1
but	1
lose	1
all	1
his	1
property?”	1
That,	1
he	1
had	1
said,	1
was	1
the	1
motto	1
of	1
the	1
middle-class;	1
now,	1
what	1
had	1
he	1
meant	1
by	1
that?	1
Of	1
course,	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
what	1
middle-class	1
people	1
believed	1
—	1
she	1
didn’t	1
know;	1
what	1
did	1
Soames	1
think?	1
He	1
answered	1
abstractedly:	1
“How	1
should	1
I	1
know?	1
Scoles	1
is	1
a	1
humbug,	1
though,	1
isn’t	1
he?”	1
For	1
Bosinney	1
was	1
looking	1
round	1
the	1
table,	1
as	1
if	1
pointing	1
out	1
the	1
peculiarities	1
of	1
the	1
guests,	1
and	1
Soames	1
wondered	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying.	1
By	1
her	1
smile	1
Irene	1
was	1
evidently	1
agreeing	1
with	1
his	1
remarks.	1
She	1
seemed	1
always	1
to	1
agree	1
with	1
other	1
people.	1
Her	1
eyes	1
were	1
turned	1
on	1
himself;	1
Soames	1
dropped	1
his	1
glance	1
at	1
once.	1
The	1
smile	1
had	1
died	1
off	1
her	1
lips.	1
A	1
humbug?	1
But	1
what	1
did	1
Soames	1
mean?	1
If	1
Mr.	1
Scoles	1
was	1
a	1
humbug,	1
a	1
clergyman	1
—	1
then	1
anybody	1
might	1
be	1
—	1
it	1
was	1
frightful!	1
“Well,	1
and	1
so	1
they	1
are!”	1
said	1
Soames.	1
During	1
Aunt	1
Juley’s	1
momentary	1
and	1
horrified	1
silence	1
he	1
caught	1
some	1
words	1
of	1
Irene’s	1
that	1
sounded	1
like:	1
‘Abandon	1
hope,	1
all	1
ye	1
who	1
enter	1
here!’	1
But	1
Swithin	1
had	1
finished	1
his	1
ham.	1
“Where	1
do	1
you	1
go	1
for	1
your	1
mushrooms?”	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
to	1
Irene	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
like	1
a	1
courtier’s;	1
“you	1
ought	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Smileybob’s	1
—	1
he’ll	1
give	1
’em	1
you	1
fresh.	1
These	1
little	1
men,	1
they	1
won’t	1
take	1
the	1
trouble!”	1
Irene	1
turned	1
to	1
answer	1
him,	1
and	1
Soames	1
saw	1
Bosinney	1
watching	1
her	1
and	1
smiling	1
to	1
himself.	1
A	1
curious	1
smile	1
the	1
fellow	1
had.	1
A	1
half-simple	1
arrangement,	1
like	1
a	1
child	1
who	1
smiles	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
pleased.	1
As	1
for	1
George’s	1
nickname	1
—‘The	1
Buccaneer’—	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
much	1
of	1
that.	1
And,	1
seeing	1
Bosinney	1
turn	1
to	1
June,	1
Soames	1
smiled	1
too,	1
but	1
sardonically	1
—	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
June,	1
who	1
was	1
not	1
looking	1
too	1
pleased.	1
This	1
was	1
not	1
surprising,	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
just	1
held	1
the	1
following	1
conversation	1
with	1
James:	1
“I	1
stayed	1
on	1
the	1
river	1
on	1
my	1
way	1
home,	1
Uncle	1
James,	1
and	1
saw	1
a	1
beautiful	1
site	1
for	1
a	1
house.”	1
James,	1
a	1
slow	1
and	1
thorough	1
eater,	1
stopped	1
the	1
process	1
of	1
mastication.	1
“Eh?”	1
he	1
said.	1
“Now,	1
where	1
was	1
that?”	1
“Close	1
to	1
Pangbourne.”	1
James	1
placed	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
ham	1
in	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
June	1
waited.	1
“I	1
suppose	1
you	1
wouldn’t	1
know	1
whether	1
the	1
land	1
about	1
there	1
was	1
freehold?”	1
he	1
asked	1
at	1
last.	1
“You	1
wouldn’t	1
know	1
anything	1
about	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
land	1
about	1
there?”	1
“Yes,”	1
said	1
June;	1
“I	1
made	1
inquiries.”	1
Her	1
little	1
resolute	1
face	1
under	1
its	1
copper	1
crown	1
was	1
suspiciously	1
eager	1
and	1
aglow.	1
James	1
regarded	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
an	1
inquisitor.	1
“What?	1
You’re	1
not	1
thinking	1
of	1
buying	1
land!”	1
he	1
ejaculated,	1
dropping	1
his	1
fork.	1
June	1
was	1
greatly	1
encouraged	1
by	1
his	1
interest.	1
It	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
her	1
pet	1
plan	1
that	1
her	1
uncles	1
should	1
benefit	1
themselves	1
and	1
Bosinney	1
by	1
building	1
country-houses.	1
“Of	1
course	1
not,”	1
she	1
said.	1
“I	1
thought	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
such	1
a	1
splendid	1
place	1
for	1
—	1
you	1
or	1
—	1
someone	1
to	1
build	1
a	1
country-house!”	1
James	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
sideways,	1
and	1
placed	1
a	1
second	1
piece	1
of	1
ham	1
in	1
his	1
mouth.	1
.	3
“Land	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
dear	1
about	1
there,”	1
he	1
said.	1
What	1
June	1
had	1
taken	1
for	1
personal	1
interest	1
was	1
only	1
the	1
impersonal	1
excitement	1
of	1
every	1
Forsyte	1
who	1
hears	1
of	1
something	1
eligible	1
in	1
danger	1
of	1
passing	1
into	1
other	1
hands.	1
But	1
she	1
refused	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
disappearance	1
of	1
her	1
chance,	1
and	1
continued	1
to	1
press	1
her	1
point.	1
“You	1
ought	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
country,	1
Uncle	1
James.	1
I	1
wish	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
money,	1
I	1
wouldn’t	1
live	1
another	1
day	1
in	1
London.”	1
James	1
was	1
stirred	1
to	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
his	1
long	1
thin	1
figure;	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
idea	1
his	1
niece	1
held	1
such	1
downright	1
views.	1
“Why	1
don’t	1
you	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
country?”	1
repeated	1
June;	1
“it	1
would	1
do	1
you	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
good.”	1
“Why?”	1
began	1
James	1
in	1
a	1
fluster.	1
“Buying	1
land	1
—	1
what	1
good	1
d’you	1
suppose	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
buying	1
land,	1
building	1
houses?	1
—	1
I	1
couldn’t	1
get	1
four	1
per	1
cent.	1
for	1
my	1
money!”	1
“What	1
does	1
that	1
matter?	1
You’d	1
get	1
fresh	1
air.”	1
“Fresh	1
air!”	1
exclaimed	1
James;	1
“what	1
should	1
I	1
do	1
with	1
fresh	1
air,”	1
“I	1
should	1
have	1
thought	1
anybody	1
liked	1
to	1
have	1
fresh	1
air,”	1
said	1
June	1
scornfully.	1
James	1
wiped	1
his	1
napkin	1
all	1
over	1
his	1
mouth.	1
“You	1
don’t	1
know	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
money,”	1
he	1
said,	1
avoiding	1
her	1
eye.	1
“No!	1
and	1
I	1
hope	1
I	1
never	1
shall!”	1
and,	1
biting	1
her	1
lip	1
with	1
inexpressible	1
mortification,	1
poor	1
June	1
was	1
silent.	1
Why	1
were	1
her	1
own	1
relations	1
so	1
rich,	1
and	1
Phil	1
never	1
knew	1
where	1
the	1
money	1
was	1
coming	1
from	1
for	1
to-morrow’s	1
tobacco.	1
Why	1
couldn’t	1
they	1
do	1
something	1
for	1
him?	1
But	1
they	1
were	1
so	1
selfish.	1
Why	1
couldn’t	1
they	1
build	1
country-houses?	1
She	1
had	1
all	1
that	1
naive	1
dogmatism	1
which	1
is	1
so	1
pathetic,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
achieves	1
such	1
great	1
results.	1
Bosinney,	1
to	1
whom	1
she	1
turned	1
in	1
her	1
discomfiture,	1
was	1
talking	1
to	1
Irene,	1
and	1
a	1
chill	1
fell	1
on	1
June’s	1
spirit.	1
Her	1
eyes	1
grew	1
steady	1
with	1
anger,	1
like	1
old	1
Jolyon’s	1
when	1
his	1
will	1
was	1
crossed.	1
James,	1
too,	1
was	1
much	1
disturbed.	1
He	1
felt	1
as	1
though	1
someone	1
had	1
threatened	1
his	1
right	1
to	1
invest	1
his	1
money	1
at	1
five	1
per	1
cent.	1
Jolyon	1
had	1
spoiled	1
her.	1
None	1
of	1
his	1
girls	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
such	1
a	1
thing.	1
James	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
exceedingly	1
liberal	1
to	1
his	1
children,	1
and	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
this	1
made	1
him	1
feel	1
it	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
deeply.	1
He	1
trifled	1
moodily	1
with	1
his	1
strawberries,	1
then,	1
deluging	1
them	1
with	1
cream,	1
he	1
ate	1
them	1
quickly;	1
they,	1
at	1
all	1
events,	1
should	1
not	1
escape	1
him.	1
No	1
wonder	1
he	1
was	1
upset.	1
Engaged	1
for	1
fifty-four	1
years	1
(he	1
had	1
been	1
admitted	1
a	1
solicitor	1
on	1
the	1
earliest	1
day	1
sanctioned	1
by	1
the	1
law)	1
in	1
arranging	1
mortgages,	1
preserving	1
investments	1
at	1
a	1
dead	1
level	1
of	1
high	1
and	1
safe	1
interest,	1
conducting	1
negotiations	1
on	1
the	1
principle	1
of	1
securing	1
the	1
utmost	1
possible	1
out	1
of	1
other	1
people	1
compatible	1
with	1
safety	1
to	1
his	1
clients	1
and	1
himself,	1
in	1
calculations	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
exact	1
pecuniary	1
possibilities	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
relations	1
of	1
life,	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
at	1
last	1
to	1
think	1
purely	1
in	1
terms	1
of	1
money.	1
Money	1
was	1
now	1
his	1
light,	1
his	1
medium	1
for	1
seeing,	1
that	1
without	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
really	1
unable	1
to	1
see,	1
really	1
not	1
cognisant	1
of	1
phenomena;	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
this	1
thing,	1
“I	1
hope	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
know	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
money!”	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
face,	1
saddened	1
and	1
exasperated	1
him.	1
He	1
knew	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
nonsense,	1
or	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
frightened	1
him.	1
What	1
was	1
the	1
world	1
coming	1
to!	1
Suddenly	1
recollecting	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
young	1
Jolyon,	1
however,	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
little	1
comforted,	1
for	1
what	1
could	1
you	1
expect	1
with	1
a	1
father	1
like	1
that!	1
This	1
turned	1
his	1
thoughts	1
into	1
a	1
channel	1
still	1
less	1
pleasant.	1
What	1
was	1
all	1
this	1
talk	1
about	1
Soames	1
and	1
Irene?	1
As	1
in	1
all	1
self-respecting	1
families,	1
an	1
emporium	1
had	1
been	1
established	1
where	1
family	1
secrets	1
were	1
bartered,	1
and	1
family	1
stock	1
priced.	1
It	1
was	1
known	1
on	1
Forsyte	1
‘Change	1
that	1
Irene	1
regretted	1
her	1
marriage.	1
Her	1
regret	1
was	1
disapproved	1
of.	1
She	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
known	1
her	1
own	1
mind;	1
no	1
dependable	1
woman	1
made	1
these	1
mistakes.	1
James	1
reflected	1
sourly	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
nice	1
house	1
(rather	1
small)	1
in	1
an	1
excellent	1
position,	1
no	1
children,	1
and	1
no	1
money	1
troubles.	1
Soames	1
was	1
reserved	1
about	1
his	1
affairs,	1
but	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
getting	1
a	1
very	1
warm	1
man.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
capital	1
income	1
from	1
the	1
business	1
—	1
for	1
Soames,	1
like	1
his	1
father,	1
was	1
a	1
member	1
of	1
that	1
well-known	1
firm	1
of	1
solicitors,	1
Forsyte,	1
Bustard	1
and	1
Forsyte	1
—	1
and	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
very	1
careful.	1
He	1
had	1
done	1
quite	1
unusually	1
well	1
with	1
some	1
mortgages	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
up,	1
too	1
—	1
a	1
little	1
timely	1
foreclosure	1
—	1
most	1
lucky	1
hits!	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
reason	1
why	1
Irene	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
happy,	1
yet	1
they	1
said	1
she’d	1
been	1
asking	1
for	1
a	1
separate	1
room.	1
He	1
knew	1
where	1
that	1
ended.	1
It	1
wasn’t	1
as	1
if	1
Soames	1
drank.	1
James	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
daughter-in-law.	1
That	1
unseen	1
glance	1
of	1
his	1
was	1
cold	1
and	1
dubious.	1
Appeal	1
and	1
fear	1
were	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
personal	1
grievance.	1
Why	1
should	1
he	1
be	1
worried	1
like	1
this?	1
It	1
was	1
very	1
likely	1
all	1
nonsense;	1
women	1
were	1
funny	1
things!	1
They	1
exaggerated	1
so,	1
you	1
didn’t	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
believe;	1
and	1
then,	1
nobody	1
told	1
him	1
anything,	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
everything	1
for	1
himself.	1
Again	1
he	1
looked	1
furtively	1
at	1
Irene,	1
and	1
across	1
from	1
her	1
to	1
Soames.	1
The	1
latter,	1
listening	1
to	1
Aunt	1
Juley,	1
was	1
looking	1
up,	1
under	1
his	1
brows	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
Bosinney.	1
‘He’s	1
fond	1
of	1
her,	1
I	1
know,’	1
thought	1
James.	1
‘Look	1
at	1
the	1
way	1
he’s	1
always	1
giving	1
her	1
things.’	1
And	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
unreasonableness	1
of	1
her	1
disaffection	1
struck	1
him	1
with	1
increased	1
force.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
pity,	1
too,	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
taking	1
little	1
thing,	1
and	1
he,	1
James,	1
would	1
be	1
really	1
quite	1
fond	1
of	1
her	1
if	1
she’d	1
only	1
let	1
him.	1
She	1
had	1
taken	1
up	1
lately	1
with	1
June;	1
that	1
was	1
doing	1
her	1
no	1
good,	1
that	1
was	1
certainly	1
doing	1
her	1
no	1
good.	1
She	1
was	1
getting	1
to	1
have	1
opinions	1
of	1
her	1
own.	1
He	1
didn’t	1
know	1
what	1
she	1
wanted	1
with	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
sort.	1
She’d	1
a	1
good	1
home,	1
and	1
everything	1
she	1
could	1
wish	1
for.	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
her	1
friends	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
chosen	1
for	1
her.	1
To	1
go	1
on	1
like	1
this	1
was	1
dangerous.	1
June,	1
indeed,	1
with	1
her	1
habit	1
of	1
championing	1
the	1
unfortunate,	1
had	1
dragged	1
from	1
Irene	1
a	1
confession,	1
and,	1
in	1
return,	1
had	1
preached	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
facing	1
the	1
evil,	1
by	1
separation,	1
if	1
need	1
be.	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
these	1
exhortations,	1
Irene	1
had	1
kept	1
a	1
brooding	1
silence,	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
found	1
terrible	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
this	1
struggle	1
carried	1
through	1
in	1
cold	1
blood.	1
He	1
would	1
never	1
give	1
her	1
up,	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
to	1
June.	1
“Who	1
cares?”	1
June	1
cried;	1
“let	1
him	1
do	1
what	1
he	1
likes	1
—	1
you’ve	1
only	1
to	1
stick	1
to	1
it!”	1
And	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
scrupled	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
of	1
this	1
sort	1
at	1
Timothy’s;	1
James,	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
of	1
it,	1
had	1
felt	1
a	1
natural	1
indignation	1
and	1
horror.	1
What	1
if	1
Irene	1
were	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
into	1
her	1
head	1
to	1
—	1
he	1
could	1
hardly	1
frame	1
the	1
thought	1
—	1
to	1
leave	1
Soames?	1
But	1
he	1
felt	1
this	1
thought	1
so	1
unbearable	1
that	1
he	1
at	1
once	1
put	1
it	1
away;	1
the	1
shady	1
visions	1
it	1
conjured	1
up,	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
family	1
tongues	1
buzzing	1
in	1
his	1
ears,	1
the	1
horror	1
of	1
the	1
conspicuous	1
happening	1
so	1
close	1
to	1
him,	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
children!	1
Luckily,	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
money	1
—	1
a	1
beggarly	1
fifty	1
pound	1
a	1
year!	1
And	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
deceased	1
Heron,	1
who	1
had	2
nothing	1
to	1
leave	1
her,	1
with	1
contempt.	1
Brooding	1
over	1
his	1
glass,	1
his	1
long	1
legs	1
twisted	1
under	1
the	1
table,	1
he	1
quite	1
omitted	1
to	1
rise	1
when	1
the	1
ladies	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
He	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
Soames	1
—	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
put	1
him	1
on	1
his	1
guard;	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
on	1
like	1
this,	1
now	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
contingency	1
had	1
occurred	1
to	1
him.	1
And	1
he	1
noticed	1
with	1
sour	1
disfavour	1
that	1
June	1
had	1
left	1
her	1
wine-glasses	1
full	1
of	1
wine.	1
‘That	1
little,	1
thing’s	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
it	1
all,’	1
he	1
mused;	1
‘Irene’d	1
never	1
have	1
thought	1
of	1
it	1
herself.’	1
James	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
imagination.	1
The	1
voice	1
of	1
Swithin	1
roused	1
him	1
from	1
his	1
reverie.	1
“I	1
gave	1
four	1
hundred	1
pounds	1
for	1
it,”	1
he	1
was	1
saying.	1
“Of	1
course	1
it’s	1
a	1
regular	1
work	1
of	1
art.”	1
“Four	1
hundred!	1
H’m!	1
that’s	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
money!”	1
chimed	1
in	1
Nicholas.	1
The	1
object	1
alluded	1
to	1
was	1
an	1
elaborate	1
group	1
of	1
statuary	1
in	1
Italian	1
marble,	1
which,	1
placed	1
upon	1
a	1
lofty	1
stand	1
(also	1
of	1
marble),	1
diffused	1
an	1
atmosphere	1
of	1
culture	1
throughout	1
the	1
room.	1
The	1
subsidiary	1
figures,	1
of	1
which	1
there	1
were	1
six,	1
female,	1
nude,	1
and	1
of	1
highly	1
ornate	1
workmanship,	1
were	1
all	1
pointing	1
towards	1
the	1
central	1
figure,	1
also	1
nude,	1
and	1
female,	1
who	1
was	1
pointing	1
at	1
herself;	1
and	1
all	1
this	1
gave	1
the	1
observer	1
a	1
very	1
pleasant	1
sense	1
of	1
her	1
extreme	1
value.	1
Aunt	1
Juley,	1
nearly	1
opposite,	1
had	2
the	1
greatest	1
difficulty	1
in	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
it	1
all	1
the	1
evening.	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
spoke;	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
who	1
had	1
started	1
the	1
discussion.	1
“Four	1
hundred	1
fiddlesticks!	1
Don’t	1
tell	1
me	1
you	1
gave	1
four	1
hundred	1
for	1
that?”	1
Between	1
the	1
points	1
of	1
his	1
collar	1
Swithin’s	1
chin	1
made	1
the	1
second	1
painful	1
oscillatory	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
evening.	1
“Four-hundred-pounds,	1
of	1
English	1
money;	1
not	1
a	1
farthing	1
less.	1
I	1
don’t	1
regret	1
it.	1
It’s	1
not	1
common	1
English	1
—	1
it’s	1
genuine	1
modern	1
Italian!”	1
Soames	1
raised	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
his	1
lip	1
in	1
a	1
smile,	1
and	1
looked	1
across	1
at	1
Bosinney.	1
The	1
architect	1
was	1
grinning	1
behind	1
the	1
fumes	1
of	1
his	1
cigarette.	1
Now,	1
indeed,	1
he	1
looked	1
more	1
like	1
a	1
buccaneer.	1
“There’s	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
work	1
about	1
it,”	1
remarked	1
James	1
hastily,	1
who	1
was	1
really	1
moved	1
by	1
the	1
size	1
of	1
the	1
group.	1
“It’d	1
sell	1
well	1
at	1
Jobson’s.”	1
“The	1
poor	1
foreign	1
dey-vil	1
that	1
made	1
it,”	1
went	1
on	1
Swithin,	1
“asked	1
me	1
five	1
hundred	1
—	1
I	1
gave	1
him	1
four.	1
It’s	1
worth	1
eight.	1
Looked	1
half-starved,	1
poor	1
dey-vil!”	1
“Ah!”	1
chimed	1
in	1
Nicholas	1
suddenly,	1
“poor,	1
seedy-lookin’	1
chaps,	1
these	1
artists;	1
it’s	1
a	1
wonder	1
to	1
me	1
how	1
they	1
live.	1
Now,	1
there’s	1
young	1
Flageoletti,	1
that	1
Fanny	1
and	1
the	1
girls	1
are	1
always	1
hav’in’	1
in,	1
to	1
play	1
the	1
fiddle;	1
if	1
he	1
makes	1
a	1
hundred	1
a	1
year	1
it’s	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
ever	1
he	1
does!”	1
James	1
shook	1
his	1
head.	1
“Ah!”	1
he	1
said,	1
“I	1
don’t	1
know	1
how	1
they	1
live!”	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
had	1
risen,	1
and,	1
cigar	1
in	1
mouth,	1
went	1
to	1
inspect	1
the	1
group	1
at	1
close	1
quarters.	1
“Wouldn’t	1
have	1
given	1
two	1
for	1
it!”	1
he	1
pronounced	1
at	1
last.	1
Soames	1
saw	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
Nicholas	1
glance	1
at	1
each	1
other	1
anxiously;	1
and,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
Swithin,	1
Bosinney,	1
still	1
shrouded	1
in	1
smoke.	1
‘I	1
wonder	1
what	1
he	1
thinks	1
of	1
it?’	1
thought	1
Soames,	1
who	1
knew	1
well	1
enough	1
that	1
this	1
group	1
was	1
hopelessly	1
vieux	1
jeu;	1
hopelessly	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
generation.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
any	1
sale	1
at	1
Jobson’s	1
for	1
such	1
works	1
of	1
art.	1
Swithin’s	1
answer	1
came	1
at	1
last.	1
“You	1
never	1
knew	1
anything	1
about	1
a	1
statue.	1
You’ve	1
got	1
your	1
pictures,	1
and	1
that’s	1
all!”	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
walked	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
seat,	1
puffing	1
his	1
cigar.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
likely	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
drawn	1
into	1
an	1
argument	1
with	1
an	1
obstinate	1
beggar	1
like	1
Swithin,	1
pig-headed	1
as	1
a	1
mule,	1
who	1
had	1
never	1
known	1
a	1
statue	1
from	1
a	1
—-straw	1
hat.	1
“Stucco!”	1
was	1
all	1
he	1
said.	1
It	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
physically	1
impossible	1
for	1
Swithin	1
to	1
start;	1
his	1
fist	1
came	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
table.	1
“Stucco!	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
anything	1
you’ve	1
got	1
in	1
your	1
house	1
half	1
as	1
good!”	1
And	1
behind	1
his	1
speech	1
seemed	1
to	1
sound	1
again	1
that	1
rumbling	1
violence	1
of	1
primitive	1
generations.	1
It	1
was	1
James	1
who	1
saved	1
the	1
situation.	1
“Now,	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
say,	1
Mr.	1
Bosinney?	1
You’re	1
an	1
architect;	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
statues	1
and	1
things!”	1
Every	1
eye	1
was	1
turned	1
upon	1
Bosinney;	1
all	1
waited	1
with	1
a	1
strange,	1
suspicious	1
look	1
for	1
his	1
answer.	1
And	1
Soames,	1
speaking	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time,	1
asked:	1
“Yes,	1
Bosinney,	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
say?”	1
Bosinney	1
replied	1
coolly:	1
“The	1
work	1
is	1
a	1
remarkable	1
one.”	1
His	1
words	1
were	1
addressed	1
to	1
Swithin,	1
his	1
eyes	1
smiled	1
slyly	1
at	1
old	1
Jolyon;	1
only	1
Soames	1
remained	1
unsatisfied.	1
“Remarkable	1
for	1
what?”	1
“For	1
its	1
naivete”	1
The	1
answer	1
was	1
followed	1
by	1
an	1
impressive	1
silence;	1
Swithin	1
alone	1
was	1
not	1
sure	1
whether	1
a	1
compliment	1
was	1
intended.	1
Chapter	1
4	1
Projection	1
of	1
the	1
House	1
Soames	1
Forsyte	1
walked	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
green-painted	1
front	1
door	1
three	1
days	1
after	1
the	1
dinner	1
at	1
Swithin’s,	1
and	1
looking	1
back	1
from	1
across	1
the	1
Square,	1
confirmed	1
his	1
impression	1
that	1
the	1
house	1
wanted	1
painting.	1
He	1
had	1
left	1
his	1
wife	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
sofa	1
in	1
the	1
drawing-room,	1
her	1
hands	1
crossed	1
in	1
her	1
lap,	1
manifestly	1
waiting	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
out.	1
This	1
was	1
not	1
unusual.	1
It	1
happened,	1
in	1
fact,	1
every	1
day.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
what	1
she	1
found	1
wrong	1
with	1
him.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
drank!	1
Did	1
he	1
run	1
into	1
debt,	1
or	1
gamble,	1
or	1
swear;	1
was	1
he	1
violent;	1
were	1
his	1
friends	1
rackety;	1
did	1
he	1
stay	1
out	1
at	1
night?	1
On	1
the	1
contrary.	1
The	1
profound,	1
subdued	1
aversion	1
which	1
he	1
felt	1
in	1
his	1
wife	1
was	1
a	1
mystery	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
a	1
source	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
terrible	1
irritation.	1
That	1
she	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
mistake,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
love	1
him,	1
had	1
tried	1
to	1
love	1
him	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
love	1
him,	1
was	1
obviously	1
no	1
reason.	1
He	1
that	1
could	1
imagine	1
so	1
outlandish	1
a	1
cause	1
for	1
his	1
wife’s	1
not	1
getting	1
on	1
with	1
him	1
was	1
certainly	1
no	1
Forsyte.	1
Soames	1
was	1
forced,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
set	1
the	1
blame	1
entirely	1
down	1
to	1
his	1
wife.	1
He	1
had	1
never	1
met	1
a	1
woman	1
so	1
capable	1
of	1
inspiring	1
affection.	1
They	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
anywhere	1
without	1
his	1
seeing	1
how	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
were	1
attracted	1
by	1
her;	1
their	1
looks,	1
manners,	1
voices,	1
betrayed	1
it;	1
her	1
behaviour	1
under	1
this	1
attention	1
had	1
been	1
beyond	1
reproach.	1
That	1
she	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
women	1
—	1
not	1
too	1
common	1
in	1
the	1
Anglo-Saxon	1
race	1
—	1
born	1
to	1
be	1
loved	1
and	1
to	1
love,	1
who	1
when	1
not	1
loving	1
are	1
not	1
living,	1
had	1
certainly	1
never	1
even	1
occurred	1
to	1
him.	1
Her	1
power	1
of	1
attraction,	1
he	1
regarded	1
as	1
part	1
of	1
her	1
value	1
as	1
his	1
property;	1
but	1
it	1
made	1
him,	1
indeed,	1
suspect	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
give	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
receive;	1
and	1
she	1
gave	1
him	1
nothing!	1
‘Then	1
why	1
did	1
she	1
marry	1
me?’	1
was	1
his	1
continual	1
thought.	1
He	1
had,	1
forgotten	1
his	1
courtship;	1
that	1
year	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
besieged	1
and	1
lain	1
in	1
wait	1
for	1
her,	1
devising	1
schemes	1
for	1
her	1
entertainment,	1
giving	1
her	1
presents,	1
proposing	1
to	1
her	1
periodically,	1
and	1
keeping	1
her	1
other	1
admirers	1
away	1
with	1
his	1
perpetual	1
presence.	1
He	1
had	1
forgotten	1
the	1
day	1
when,	1
adroitly	1
taking	1
advantage	1
of	1
an	1
acute	1
phase	1
of	1
her	1
dislike	1
to	1
her	1
home	1
surroundings,	1
he	1
crowned	1
his	1
labours	1
with	1
success.	1
If	1
he	1
remembered	1
anything,	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
dainty	1
capriciousness	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
gold-haired,	1
dark-eyed	1
girl	1
had	1
treated	1
him.	1
He	1
certainly	1
did	1
not	1
remember	1
the	1
look	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
—	1
strange,	1
passive,	1
appealing	1
—	1
when	1
suddenly	1
one	1
day	1
she	1
had	1
yielded,	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
marry	1
him.	1
It	1
had	1
been	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
real	1
devoted	1
wooings	1
which	1
books	1
and	1
people	1
praise,	1
when	1
the	1
lover	1
is	1
at	1
length	1
rewarded	1
for	1
hammering	1
the	1
iron	1
till	1
it	1
is	1
malleable,	1
and	1
all	1
must	1
be	1
happy	1
ever	1
after	1
as	1
the	1
wedding	1
bells.	1
Soames	1
walked	1
eastwards,	1
mousing	1
doggedly	1
along	1
on	1
the	1
shady	1
side.	1
The	1
house	1
wanted	1
doing,	1
up,	1
unless	1
he	1
decided	1
to	1
move	1
into	1
the	1
country,	1
and	1
build.	1
For	1
the	1
hundredth	1
time	1
that	1
month	1
he	1
turned	1
over	1
this	1
problem.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
use	1
in	1
rushing	1
into	1
things!	1
He	1
was	1
very	1
comfortably	1
off,	1
with	1
an	1
increasing	1
income	1
getting	1
on	1
for	1
three	1
thousand	1
a	1
year;	1
but	1
his	1
invested	1
capital	1
was	1
not	1
perhaps	1
so	1
large	1
as	1
his	1
father	1
believed	1
—	1
James	1
had	1
a	1
tendency	1
to	1
expect	1
that	1
his	1
children	1
should	1
be	1
better	1
off	1
than	1
they	1
were.	1
‘I	1
can	1
manage	1
eight	1
thousand	1
easily	1
enough,’	1
he	1
thought,	1
‘without	1
calling	1
in	1
either	1
Robertson’s	1
or	1
Nicholl’s.’	1
He	1
had	1
stopped	1
to	1
look	1
in	1
at	1
a	1
picture	1
shop,	1
for	1
Soames	1
was	1
an	1
‘amateur’	1
of	1
pictures,	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
little-room	1
in	1
No.	1
62,	1
Montpellier	1
Square,	1
full	1
of	1
canvases,	1
stacked	1
against	1
the	1
wall,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
room	1
to	1
hang.	1
He	1
brought	1
them	1
home	1
with	1
him	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
City,	1
generally	1
after	1
dark,	1
and	1
would	1
enter	1
this	1
room	1
on	1
Sunday	1
afternoons,	1
to	1
spend	1
hours	1
turning	1
the	1
pictures	1
to	1
the	1
light,	1
examining	1
the	1
marks	1
on	1
their	1
backs,	1
and	1
occasionally	1
making	1
notes.	1
They	1
were	1
nearly	1
all	1
landscapes	1
with	1
figures	1
in	1
the	1
foreground,	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
some	1
mysterious	1
revolt	1
against	1
London,	1
its	1
tall	1
houses,	1
its	1
interminable	1
streets,	1
where	1
his	1
life	1
and	1
the	1
lives	1
of	1
his	1
breed	1
and	1
class	1
were	1
passed.	1
Every	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
would	1
take	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
pictures	1
away	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
cab,	1
and	1
stop	1
at	1
Jobson’s	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
into	1
the	1
City.	1
He	1
rarely	1
showed	1
them	1
to	1
anyone;	1
Irene,	1
whose	1
opinion	1
he	1
secretly	1
respected	1
and	1
perhaps	1
for	1
that	1
reason	1
never	1
solicited,	1
had	1
only	1
been	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
on	1
rare	1
occasions,	1
in	1
discharge	1
of	1
some	1
wifely	1
duty.	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
asked	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
pictures,	1
and	1
she	1
never	1
did.	1
To	1
Soames	1
this	1
was	1
another	1
grievance.	1
He	1
hated	1
that	1
pride	1
of	1
hers,	1
and	1
secretly	1
dreaded	1
it.	1
In	1
the	1
plate-glass	1
window	1
of	1
the	1
picture	1
shop	1
his	1
image	1
stood	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
him.	1
His	1
sleek	1
hair	1
under	1
the	1
brim	1
of	1
the	1
tall	1
hat	1
had	1
a	1
sheen	1
like	1
the	1
hat	1
itself;	1
his	1
cheeks,	1
pale	1
and	1
flat,	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
his	1
clean-shaven	1
lips,	1
his	1
firm	1
chin	1
with	1
its	1
greyish	1
shaven	1
tinge,	1
and	1
the	1
buttoned	1
strictness	1
of	1
his	1
black	1
cut-away	1
coat,	1
conveyed	1
an	1
appearance	1
of	1
reserve	1
and	1
secrecy,	1
of	1
imperturbable,	1
enforced	1
composure;	1
but	1
his	1
eyes,	1
cold	1
—	1
grey,	1
strained	1
—	1
looking,	1
with	1
a	1
line	1
in	1
the	1
brow	1
between	1
them,	1
examined	1
him	1
wistfully,	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
knew	1
of	1
a	1
secret	1
weakness.	1
He	1
noted	1
the	1
subjects	1
of	1
the	1
pictures,	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
painters,	1
made	1
a	1
calculation	1
of	1
their	1
values,	1
but	1
without	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
he	1
usually	1
derived	1
from	1
this	1
inward	1
appraisement,	1
and	1
walked	1
on.	1
No.	1
62	1
would	1
do	1
well	1
enough	1
for	1
another	1
year,	1
if	1
he	1
decided	1
to	1
build!	1
The	1
times	1
were	1
good	1
for	1
building,	1
money	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
so	1
dear	1
for	1
years;	1
and	1
the	1
site	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
at	1
Robin	1
Hill,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
down	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
spring	1
to	1
inspect	1
the	1
Nicholl	1
mortgage	1
—	1
what	1
could	1
be	1
better!	1
Within	1
twelve	1
miles	1
of	1
Hyde	1
Park	1
Corner,	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
the	1
land	1
certain	1
to	1
go	1
up,	1
would	1
always	1
fetch	1
more	1
than	1
he	1
gave	1
for	1
it;	1
so	1
that	1
a	1
house,	1
if	1
built	1
in	1
really	1
good	1
style,	1
was	1
a	1
first-class	1
investment.	1
The	1
notion	1
of	1
being	1
the	1
one	1
member	1
of	1
his	1
family	1
with	1
a	1
country	1
house	1
weighed	1
but	1
little	1
with	1
him;	1
for	1
to	1
a	1
true	1
Forsyte,	1
sentiment,	1
even	1
the	1
sentiment	1
of	1
social	1
position,	1
was	1
a	1
luxury	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
indulged	1
in	1
after	1
his	1
appetite	1
for	1
more	1
material	1
pleasure	1
had	1
been	1
satisfied.	1
To	1
get	1
Irene	1
out	1
of	1
London,	1
away	1
from	1
opportunities	1
of	1
going	1
about	1
and	1
seeing	1
people,	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
friends	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
put	1
ideas	1
into	1
her	1
head!	1
That	1
was	1
the	1
thing!	1
She	1
was	1
too	1
thick	1
with	1
June!	1
June	1
disliked	1
him.	1
He	1
returned	1
the	1
sentiment.	1
They	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
blood.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
everything	1
to	1
get	1
Irene	1
out	1
of	1
town.	1
The	1
house	1
would	1
please	1
her	1
she	1
would	1
enjoy	1
messing	1
about	1
with	1
the	1
decoration,	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
artistic!	1
The	1
house	1
must	1
be	1
in	1
good	1
style,	1
something	1
that	1
would	1
always	1
be	1
certain	1
to	1
command	1
a	1
price,	1
something	1
unique,	1
like	1
that	1
last	1
house	1
of	1
Parkes,	1
which	1
had	1
a	1
tower;	1
but	1
Parkes	1
had	1
himself	1
said	1
that	1
his	1
architect	1
was	1
ruinous.	1
You	1
never	1
knew	1
where	1
you	1
were	1
with	1
those	1
fellows;	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
name	1
they	1
ran	1
you	1
into	1
no	1
end	1
of	1
expense	1
and	1
were	1
conceited	1
into	1
the	1
bargain.	1
And	1
a	1
common	1
architect	1
was	1
no	1
good	1
—	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
Parkes’	1
tower	1
precluded	1
the	1
employment	1
of	1
a	1
common	1
architect:	1
This	1
was	1
why	1
he	1
had	1
thought	1
of	1
Bosinney.	1
Since	1
the	1
dinner	1
at	1
Swithin’s	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
enquiries,	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
meagre,	1
but	1
encouraging:	1
“One	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
school.”	1
“Clever?”	1
“As	1
clever	1
as	1
you	1
like	1
—	1
a	1
bit	1
—	1
a	1
bit	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
air!”	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
discover	1
what	1
houses	1
Bosinney	1
had	1
built,	1
nor	1
what	1
his	1
charges	1
were.	1
The	1
impression	1
he	1
gathered	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
own	1
terms.	1
The	1
more	1
he	1
reflected	1
on	1
the	1
idea,	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
liked	1
it.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
keeping	1
the	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
family,	1
with	1
Forsytes	1
almost	1
an	1
instinct;	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
get	1
‘favoured-nation,’	1
if	1
not	1
nominal	1
terms	1
—	1
only	1
fair,	1
considering	1
the	1
chance	1
to	1
Bosinney	1
of	1
displaying	1
his	1
talents,	1
for	1
this	1
house	1
must	1
be	1
no	1
common	1
edifice.	1
Soames	1
reflected	1
complacently	1
on	1
the	1
work	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
young	1
man;	1
for,	1
like	1
every	1
Forsyte,	1
he	1
could	1
be	1
a	1
thorough	1
optimist	1
when	1
there	1
was	1
anything	1
to	1
be	1
had	1
out	1
of	1
it.	1
Bosinney’s	1
office	1
was	1
in	1
Sloane	1
Street,	1
close	1
at,	1
hand,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
eye	1
continually	1
on	1
the	1
plans.	1
Again,	1
Irene	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
to	1
likely	1
to	1
object	1
to	1
leave	1
London	1
if	1
her	1
greatest	1
friend’s	1
lover	1
were	1
given	1
the	1
job.	1
June’s	1
marriage	1
might	1
depend	1
on	1
it.	1
Irene	1
could	1
not	1
decently	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
June’s	1
marriage;	1
she	1
would	1
never	1
do	1
that,	1
he	1
knew	1
her	1
too	1
well.	1
And	1
June	1
would	1
be	1
pleased;	1
of	1
this	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
advantage.	1
Bosinney	1
looked	1
clever,	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
also	1
—	1
and	1
—	1
it	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
great	1
attractions	1
—	1
an	1
air	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
quite	1
know	1
on	1
which	1
side	1
his	1
bread	1
were	1
buttered;	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
easy	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
in	1
money	1
matters.	1
Soames	1
made	1
this	1
reflection	1
in	1
no	1
defrauding	1
spirit;	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
natural	1
attitude	1
of	1
his	1
mind	1
—	1
of	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
any	1
good	1
business	1
man	1
—	1
of	1
all	1
those	1
thousands	1
of	1
good	1
business	1
men	1
through	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
threading	1
his	1
way	1
up	1
Ludgate	1
Hill.	1
Thus	1
he	1
fulfilled	1
the	1
inscrutable	1
laws	1
of	1
his	1
great	1
class	1
—	1
of	1
human	1
nature	1
itself	1
—	1
when	1
he	1
reflected,	1
with	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
comfort,	1
that	1
Bosinney	1
would	1
be	1
easy	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
in	1
money	1
matters.	1
While	1
he	1
elbowed	1
his	1
way	1
on,	1
his	1
eyes,	1
which	1
he	1
usually	1
kept	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
before	1
his	1
feet,	1
were	1
attracted	1
upwards	1
by	1
the	1
dome	1
of	1
St.	1
Paul’s.	1
It	1
had	1
a	1
peculiar	1
fascination	1
for	1
him,	1
that	1
old	1
dome,	1
and	1
not	1
once,	1
but	1
twice	1
or	1
three	1
times	1
a	1
week,	1
would	1
he	1
halt	1
in	1
his	1
daily	1
pilgrimage	1
to	1
enter	1
beneath	1
and	1
stop	1
in	1
the	1
side	1
aisles	1
for	1
five	1
or	1
ten	1
minutes,	1
scrutinizing	1
the	1
names	1
and	1
epitaphs	1
on	1
the	1
monuments.	1
The	1
attraction	1
for	1
him	1
of	1
this	1
great	1
church	1
was	1
inexplicable,	1
unless	1
it	1
enabled	1
him	1
to	1
concentrate	1
his	1
thoughts	1
on	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
the	1
day.	1
If	1
any	1
affair	1
of	1
particular	1
moment,	1
or	1
demanding	1
peculiar	1
acuteness,	1
was	1
weighing	1
on	1
his	1
mind,	1
he	1
invariably	1
went	1
in,	1
to	1
wander	1
with	1
mouse-like	1
attention	1
from	1
epitaph	1
to	1
epitaph.	1
Then	1
retiring	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
noiseless	1
way,	1
he	1
would	1
hold	1
steadily	1
on	1
up	1
Cheapside,	1
a	1
thought	1
more	1
of	1
dogged	1
purpose	1
in	1
his	1
gait,	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
something	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
buy.	1
He	1
went	1
in	1
this	1
morning,	1
but,	1
instead	1
of	1
stealing	1
from	1
monument	1
to	1
monument,	1
turned	1
his	1
eyes	1
upwards	1
to	1
the	1
columns	1
and	1
spacings	1
of	1
the	1
walls,	1
and	1
remained	1
motionless.	1
His	1
uplifted	1
face,	1
with	1
the	1
awed	1
and	1
wistful	1
look	1
which	1
faces	1
take	1
on	1
themselves	1
in	1
church,	1
was	1
whitened	1
to	1
a	1
chalky	1
hue	1
in	1
the	1
vast	1
building.	1
His	1
gloved	1
hands	1
were	1
clasped	1
in	1
front	1
over	1
the	1
handle	1
of	1
his	1
umbrella.	1
He	1
lifted	1
them.	1
Some	1
sacred	1
inspiration	1
perhaps	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
him.	1
‘Yes,’	1
he	1
thought,	1
‘I	1
must	1
have	1
room	1
to	1
hang	1
my	1
pictures.	1
That	1
evening,	1
on	1
his	1
return	1
from	1
the	1
City,	1
he	1
called	1
at	1
Bosinney’s	1
office.	1
He	1
found	1
the	1
architect	1
in	1
his	1
shirt-sleeves,	1
smoking	1
a	1
pipe,	1
and	1
ruling	1
off	1
lines	1
on	1
a	1
plan.	1
Soames	1
refused	1
a	1
drink,	1
and	1
came	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
the	1
point.	1
“If	1
you’ve	1
nothing	1
better	1
to	1
do	1
on	1
Sunday,	1
come	1
down	1
with	1
me	1
to	1
Robin	1
Hill,	1
and	1
give	1
me	1
your	1
opinion	1
on	1
a	1
building	1
site.”	1
“Are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
build?”	1
“Perhaps,”	1
said	1
Soames;	1
“but	1
don’t	1
speak	1
of	1
it.	1
I	1
just	1
want	1
your	1
opinion.”	1
“Quite	1
so,”	1
said	1
the	1
architect.	1
Soames	1
peered	1
about	1
the	1
room.	1
“You’re	1
rather	1
high	1
up	1
here,”	1
he	1
remarked.	1
Any	1
information	1
he	1
could	1
gather	1
about	1
the	1
nature	1
and	1
scope	1
of	1
Bosinney’s	1
business	1
would	1
be	1
all	1
to	1
the	1
good.	1
“It	1
does	1
well	1
enough	1
for	1
me	1
so	1
far,”	1
answered	1
the	1
architect.	1
“You’re	1
accustomed	1
to	1
the	1
swells.”	1
He	1
knocked	1
out	1
his	1
pipe,	1
but	1
replaced	1
it	1
empty	1
between	1
his	1
teeth;	1
it	1
assisted	1
him	1
perhaps	1
to	1
carry	1
on	1
the	1
conversation.	1
Soames	1
noted	1
a	1
hollow	1
in	1
each	1
cheek,	1
made	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
by	1
suction.	1
“What	1
do	1
you	1
pay	1
for	1
an	1
office	1
like	1
this?”	1
said	1
he.	1
“Fifty	1
too	1
much,”	1
replied	1
Bosinney.	1
This	1
answer	1
impressed	1
Soames	1
favourably.	1
“I	1
suppose	1
it	1
is	1
dear,”	1
he	1
said.	1
“I’ll	1
call	1
for	1
you	1
—	1
on	1
Sunday	1
about	1
eleven.”	1
The	1
following	1
Sunday	1
therefore	1
he	1
called	1
for	1
Bosinney	1
in	1
a	1
hansom,	1
and	1
drove	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
station.	1
On	1
arriving	1
at	1
Robin	1
Hill,	1
they	1
found	1
no	1
cab,	1
and	1
started	1
to	1
walk	1
the	1
mile	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
to	1
the	1
site.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
1st	1
of	1
August	1
—	1
a	1
perfect	1
day,	1
with	1
a	1
burning	1
sun	1
and	1
cloudless	1
sky	1
—	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
straight,	1
narrow	1
road	1
leading	1
up	1
the	1
hill	1
their	1
feet	1
kicked	1
up	1
a	1
yellow	1
dust.	1
“Gravel	1
soil,”	1
remarked	1
Soames,	1
and	1
sideways	1
he	1
glanced	1
at	1
the	1
coat	1
Bosinney	1
wore.	1
Into	1
the	1
side-pockets	1
of	1
this	1
coat	1
were	1
thrust	1
bundles	1
of	1
papers,	1
and	1
under	1
one	1
arm	1
was	1
carried	1
a	1
queer-looking	1
stick.	1
Soames	1
noted	1
these	1
and	1
other	1
peculiarities.	1
No	1
one	1
but	1
a	1
clever	1
man,	1
or,	1
indeed,	1
a	1
buccaneer,	1
would	1
have	1
taken	1
such	1
liberties	1
with	1
his	1
appearance;	1
and	1
though	1
these	1
eccentricities	1
were	1
revolting	1
to	1
Soames,	1
he	1
derived	1
a	1
certain	1
satisfaction	1
from	1
them,	1
as	1
evidence	1
of	1
qualities	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
must	1
inevitably	1
profit.	1
If	1
the	1
fellow	1
could	1
build	1
houses,	1
what	1
did	1
his	1
clothes	1
matter?	1
“I	1
told	1
you,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“that	1
I	1
want	1
this	1
house	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
surprise,	1
so	1
don’t	1
say	1
anything	1
about	1
it.	1
I	1
never	1
talk	1
of	1
my	1
affairs	1
until	1
they’re	1
carried	1
through.”	1
Bosinney	1
nodded.	1
“Let	1
women	1
into	1
your	1
plans,”	1
pursued	1
Soames,	1
“and	1
you	1
never	1
know	1
where	1
it’ll	1
end.”	1
“Ah!”	1
Said	1
Bosinney,	1
“women	1
are	1
the	1
devil!”	1
This	1
feeling	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
at	1
the	1
—	1
bottom	1
of	1
Soames’s	1
heart;	1
he	1
had	1
never,	1
however,	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
words.	1
“Oh!”	1
he	1
Muttered,	1
“so	1
you’re	1
beginning	1
to.	1
.	3
”	1
He	1
stopped,	1
but	1
added,	1
with	1
an	1
uncontrollable	1
burst	1
of	1
spite:	1
“June’s	1
got	1
a	1
temper	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
—	1
always	1
had.”	1
“A	1
temper’s	1
not	1
a	1
bad	1
thing	1
in	1
an	1
angel.”	1
Soames	1
had	1
never	1
called	1
Irene	1
an	1
angel.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
so	1
have	1
violated	1
his	1
best	1
instincts,	1
letting	1
other	1
people	1
into	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
her	1
value,	1
and	1
giving	1
himself	1
away.	1
He	1
made	1
no	1
reply.	1
They	1
had	1
struck	1
into	1
a	1
half-made	1
road	1
across	1
a	1
warren.	1
A	1
cart-track	1
led	1
at	1
right-angles	1
to	1
a	1
gravel	1
pit,	1
beyond	1
which	1
the	1
chimneys	1
of	1
a	1
cottage	1
rose	1
amongst	1
a	1
clump	1
of	1
trees	1
at	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
a	1
thick	1
wood.	1
Tussocks	1
of	1
feathery	1
grass	1
covered	1
the	1
rough	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
these	1
the	1
larks	1
soared	1
into	1
the	1
hate	1
of	1
sunshine.	1
On	1
the	1
far	1
horizon,	1
over	1
a	1
countless	1
succession	1
of	1
fields	1
and	1
hedges,	1
rose	1
a	1
line	1
of	1
downs.	1
Soames	1
led	1
till	1
they	1
had	1
crossed	1
to	1
the	1
far	1
side,	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
stopped.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
chosen	1
site;	1
but	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
divulge	1
the	1
spot	1
to	1
another	1
he	1
had	1
become	1
uneasy.	1
“The	1
agent	1
lives	1
in	1
that	1
cottage,”	1
he	1
said;	1
“he’ll	1
give	1
us	1
some	1
lunch	1
—	1
we’d	1
better	1
have	1
lunch	1
before	1
we	1
go	1
into	1
this	1
matter.”	1
He	1
again	1
took	1
the	1
lead	1
to	1
the	1
cottage,	1
where	1
the	1
agent,	1
a	1
tall	1
man	1
named	1
Oliver,	1
with	1
a	1
heavy	1
face	1
and	1
grizzled	1
beard,	1
welcomed	1
them.	1
During	1
lunch,	1
which	1
Soames	1
hardly	1
touched,	1
he	1
kept	1
looking	1
at	1
Bosinney,	1
and	1
once	1
or	1
twice	1
passed	1
his	1
silk	1
handkerchief	1
stealthily	1
over	1
his	1
forehead.	1
The	1
meal	1
came	1
to	1
an	1
end	1
at	1
last,	1
and	1
Bosinney	1
rose.	1
“I	1
dare	1
say	1
you’ve	1
got	1
business	1
to	1
talk	1
over,”	1
he	1
said;	1
“I’ll	1
just	1
go	1
and	1
nose	1
about	1
a	1
bit.”	1
Without	1
waiting	1
for	1
a	1
reply	1
he	1
strolled	1
out.	1
Soames	1
was	1
solicitor	1
to	1
this	1
estate,	1
and	1
he	1
spent	1
nearly	1
an	1
hour	1
in	1
the	1
agent’s	1
company,	1
looking	1
at	1
ground-plans	1
and	1
discussing	1
the	1
Nicholl	1
and	1
other	1
mortgages;	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
by	1
an	1
afterthought	1
that	1
he	1
brought	1
up	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
the	1
building	1
site.	1
“Your	1
people,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“ought	1
to	1
come	1
down	1
in	1
their	1
price	1
to	1
me,	1
considering	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
build.”	1
Oliver	1
shook	1
his	1
head.	1
The	1
site	1
you’ve	1
fixed	1
on,	1
Sir,	1
he	1
said,	1
“is	1
the	1
cheapest	1
we’ve	1
got.	1
Sites	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
slope	1
are	1
dearer	1
by	1
a	1
good	1
bit.”	1
“Mind,”	1
said	1
Soames,	1
“I’ve	1
not	1
decided;	1
it’s	1
quite	1
possible	1
I	1
shan’t	1
build	1
at	1
all.	1
The	1
ground	1
rent’s	1
very	1
high.”	1
“Well,	1
Mr.	1
Forsyte,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
sorry	1
if	1
you	1
go	1
off,	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
you’ll	1
make	1
a	1
mistake,	1
Sir.	1
There’s	1
not	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
land	1
near	1
London	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
view	1
as	1
this,	1
nor	1
one	1
that’s	1
cheaper,	1
all	1
things	1
considered;	1
we’ve	1
only	1
to	1
advertise,	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
mob	1
of	1
people	1
after	1
it.”	1
They	1
looked	1
at	1
each	1
other.	1
Their	1
faces	1
said	1
very	1
plainly:	1
‘I	1
respect	1
you	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
business;	1
and	1
you	1
can’t	1
expect	1
me	1
to	1
believe	1
a	1
word	1
you	1
say.’	1
Well,	1
repeated	1
Soames,	1
“I	1
haven’t	1
made	1
up	1
my	1
mind;	1
the	1
thing	1
will	1
very	1
likely	1
go	1
off!”	1
With	1
these	1
words,	1
taking	1
up	1
his	1
umbrella,	1
he	1
put	1
his	1
chilly	1
hand	1
into	1
the	1
agent’s,	1
withdrew	1
it	1
without	1
the	1
faintest	1
pressure,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
sun.	1
He	1
walked	1
slowly	1
back	1
towards	1
the	1
site	1
in	1
deep	1
thought.	1
His	1
instinct	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
what	1
the	1
agent	1
had	1
said	1
was	1
true.	1
A	1
cheap	1
site.	1
And	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
it	1
was,	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
the	1
agent	1
did	1
not	1
really	1
think	1
it	1
cheap;	1
so	1
that	1
his	1
own	1
intuitive	1
knowledge	1
was	1
a	1
victory	1
over	1
the	1
agent’s.	1
‘Cheap	1
or	1
not,	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
have	1
it,’	1
he	1
thought.	1
The	1
larks	1
sprang	1
up	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
his	1
feet,	1
the	1
air	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
butterflies,	1
a	1
sweet	1
fragrance	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
wild	1
grasses.	1
The	1
sappy	1
scent	1
of	1
the	1
bracken	1
stole	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
wood,	1
where,	1
hidden	1
in	1
the	1
depths,	1
pigeons	1
were	1
cooing,	1
and	1
from	1
afar	1
on	1
the	1
warm	1
breeze,	1
came	1
the	1
rhythmic	1
chiming	1
of	1
church	1
bells.	1
Soames	1
walked	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
his	1
lips	1
opening	1
and	1
closing	1
as	1
though	1
in	1
anticipation	1
of	1
a	1
delicious	1
morsel.	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
arrived	1
at	1
the	1
site,	1
Bosinney	1
was	1
nowhere	1
to	1
be	1
seen.	1
After	1
waiting	1
some	1
little	1
time,	1
he	1
crossed	1
the	1
warren	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
slope.	1
He	1
would	1
have	1
shouted,	1
but	1
dreaded	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
his	1
voice.	1
The	1
warren	1
was	1
as	1
lonely	1
as	1
a	1
prairie,	1
its	1
silence	1
only	1
broken	1
by	1
the	1
rustle	1
of	1
rabbits	1
bolting	1
to	1
their	1
holes,	1
and	1
the	1
song	1
of	1
the	1
larks.	1
Soames,	1
the	1
pioneer-leader	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
Forsyte	1
army	1
advancing	1
to	1
the	1
civilization	1
of	1
this	1
wilderness,	1
felt	1
his	1
spirit	1
daunted	1
by	1
the	1
loneliness,	1
by	1
the	1
invisible	1
singing,	1
and	1
the	1
hot,	1
sweet	1
air.	1
He	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
retrace	1
his	1
steps	1
when	1
he	1
at	1
last	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
Bosinney.	1
The	1
architect	1
was	1
sprawling	1
under	1
a	1
large	1
oak	1
tree,	1
whose	1
trunk,	1
with	1
a	1
huge	1
spread	1
of	1
bough	1
and	1
foliage,	1
ragged	1
with	1
age,	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
verge	1
of	1
the	1
rise.	1
Soames	1
had	1
to	1
touch	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder	1
before	1
he	1
looked	1
up.	1
“Hallo!	1
Forsyte,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“I’ve	1
found	1
the	1
very	1
place	1
for	1
your	1
house!	1
Look	1
here!”	1
Soames	1
stood	1
and	1
looked,	1
then	1
he	1
said,	1
coldly:	1
“You	1
may	1
be	1
very	1
clever,	1
but	1
this	1
site	1
will	1
cost	1
me	1
half	1
as	1
much	1
again.”	1
“Hang	1
the	1
cost,	1
man.	1
Look	1
at	1
the	1
view!”	1
Almost	1
from	1
their	1
feet	1
stretched	1
ripe	1
corn,	1
dipping	1
to	1
a	1
small	1
dark	1
copse	1
beyond.	1
A	1
plain	1
of	1
fields	1
and	1
hedges	1
spread	1
to	1
the	1
distant	1
grey-bluedowns.	1
In	1
a	1
silver	1
streak	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
the	1
river.	1
The	1
sky	1
was	1
so	1
blue,	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
so	1
bright,	1
that	1
an	1
eternal	1
summer	1
seemed	1
to	1
reign	1
over	1
this	1
prospect.	1
Thistledown	1
floated	1
round	1
them,	1
enraptured	1
by	1
the	1
serenity,	1
of	1
the	1
ether.	1
The	1
heat	1
danced	1
over	1
the	1
corn,	1
and,	1
pervading	1
all,	1
was	1
a	1
soft,	1
insensible	1
hum,	1
like	1
the	1
murmur	1
of	1
bright	1
minutes	1
holding	1
revel	1
between	1
earth	1
and	1
heaven.	1
Soames	1
looked.	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
himself,	1
something	1
swelled	1
in	1
his	1
breast.	1
To	1
live	1
here	1
in	1
sight	1
of	1
all	1
this,	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
point	1
it	1
out	1
to	1
his	1
friends,	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
it,	1
to	1
possess	1
it!	1
His	1
cheeks	1
flushed.	1
The	1
warmth,	1
the	1
radiance,	1
the	1
glow,	1
were	1
sinking	1
into	1
his	1
senses	1
as,	1
four	1
years	1
before,	1
Irene’s	1
beauty	1
had	1
sunk	1
into	1
his	1
senses	1
and	1
made	1
him	1
long	1
for	1
her.	1
He	1
stole	1
a	1
glance	1
at	1
Bosinney,	1
whose	1
eyes,	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
coachman’s	1
‘half-tame	1
leopard,’	1
seemed	1
running	1
wild	1
over	1
the	1
landscape.	1
The	1
sunlight	1
had	1
caught	1
the	1
promontories	1
of	1
the	1
fellow’s	1
face,	1
the	1
bumpy	1
cheekbones,	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
his	1
chin,	1
the	1
vertical	1
ridges	1
above	1
his	1
brow;	1
and	1
Soames	1
watched	1
this	1
rugged,	1
enthusiastic,	1
careless	1
face	1
with	1
an	1
unpleasant	1
feeling.	1
A	1
long,	1
soft	1
ripple	1
of	1
wind	1
flowed	1
over	1
the	1
corn,	1
and	1
brought	1
a	1
puff	1
of	1
warm	1
air	1
into	1
their	1
faces.	1
“I	1
could	1
build	1
you	1
a	1
teaser	1
here,”	1
said	1
Bosinney,	1
breaking	1
the	1
silence	1
at	1
last.	1
“I	1
dare	1
say,”	1
replied	1
Soames,	1
drily.	1
“You	1
haven’t	1
got	1
to	1
pay	1
for	1
it.”	1
“For	1
about	1
eight	1
thousand	1
I	1
could	1
build	1
you	1
a	1
palace.”	1
Soames	1
had	1
become	1
very	1
pale	1
—	1
a	1
struggle	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
within	1
him.	1
He	1
dropped	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
said	1
stubbornly:	1
“I	1
can’t	1
afford	1
it.”	1
And	1
slowly,	1
with	1
his	1
mousing	1
walk,	1
he	1
led	1
the	1
way	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
site.	1
They	1
spent	1
some	1
time	1
there	1
going	1
into	1
particulars	1
of	1
the	1
projected	1
house,	1
and	1
then	1
Soames	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
agent’s	1
cottage.	1
He	1
came	1
out	1
in	1
about	1
half	1
an	1
hour,	1
and,	1
joining	1
Bosinney,	1
started	1
for	1
the	1
station.	1
“Well,”	1
he	1
said,	1
hardly	1
opening	1
his	1
lips,	1
“I’ve	1
taken	1
that	1
site	1
of	1
yours,	1
after	1
all.”	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
was	1
silent,	1
confusedly	1
debating	1
how	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
this	1
fellow,	1
whom	1
by	1
habit	1
he	1
despised,	1
should	1
have	1
overborne	1
his	1
own	1
decision.	1

A	1
Forsyte	1
Menage	1
Like	1
the	1
enlightened	1
thousands	1
of	1
his	1
class	1
and	1
generation	1
in	1
this	1
great	1
city	1
of	1
London,	1
who	1
no	1
longer	1
believe	1
in	1
red	1
velvet	1
chairs,	1
and	1
know	1
that	1
groups	1
of	1
modern	1
Italian	1
marble	1
are	1
‘vieux	1
jeu,’	1
Soames	1
Forsyte	1
inhabited	1
a	1
house	1
which	1
did	1
what	1
it	1
could.	1
It	1
owned	1
a	1
copper	1
door	1
knocker	1
of	1
individual	1
design,	1
windows	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
altered	1
to	1
open	1
outwards,	1
hanging	1
flower	1
boxes	1
filled	1
with	1
fuchsias,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
(a	1
great	1
feature)	1
a	1
little	1
court	1
tiled	1
with	1
jade-green	1
tiles,	1
and	1
surrounded	1
by	1
pink	1
hydrangeas	1
in	1
peacock-blue	1
tubs.	1
Here,	1
under	1
a	1
parchment-coloured	1
Japanese	1
sunshade	1
covering	1
the	1
whole	1
end,	1
inhabitants	1
or	1
visitors	1
could	1
be	1
screened	1
from	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
curious	1
while	1
they	1
drank	1
tea	1
and	1
examined	1
at	1
their	1
leisure	1
the	1
latest	1
of	1
Soames’s	1
little	1
silver	1
boxes.	1
The	1
inner	1
decoration	1
favoured	1
the	1
First	1
Empire	1
and	1
William	1
Morris.	1
For	1
its	1
size,	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
commodious;	1
there	1
were	1
countless	1
nooks	1
resembling	1
birds’	1
nests,	1
and	1
little	1
things	1
made	1
of	1
silver	1
were	1
deposited	1
like	1
eggs.	1
In	1
this	1
general	1
perfection	1
two	1
kinds	1
of	1
fastidiousness	1
were	1
at	1
war.	1
There	1
lived	1
here	1
a	1
mistress	1
who	1
would	1
have	1
dwelt	1
daintily	1
on	1
a	1
desert	1
island;	1
a	1
master	1
whose	1
daintiness	1
was,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
an	1
investment,	1
cultivated	1
by	1
the	1
owner	1
for	1
his	1
advancement,	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
competition.	1
This	1
competitive	1
daintiness	1
had	1
caused	1
Soames	1
in	1
his	1
Marlborough	1
days	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
boy	1
into	1
white	1
waistcoats	1
in	1
summer,	1
and	1
corduroy	1
waistcoats	1
in	1
winter,	1
had	1
prevented	1
him	1
from	1
ever	1
appearing	1
in	1
public	1
with	1
his	1
tie	1
climbing	1
up	1
his	1
collar,	1
and	1
induced	1
him	1
to	1
dust	1
his	1
patent	1
leather	1
boots	1
before	1
a	1
great	1
multitude	1
assembled	1
on	1
Speech	1
Day	1
to	1
hear	1
him	1
recite	1
Moliere.	1
Skin-like	1
immaculateness	1
had	1
grown	1
over	1
Soames,	1
as	1
over	1
many	1
Londoners;	1
impossible	1
to	1
conceive	1
of	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
hair	1
out	1
of	1
place,	1
a	1
tie	1
deviating	1
one-eighth	1
of	1
an	1
inch	1
from	1
the	1
perpendicular,	1
a	1
collar	1
unglossed!	1
He	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
gone	1
without	1
a	1
bath	1
for	1
worlds	1
—	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
fashion	1
to	1
take	1
baths;	1
and	1
how	1
bitter	1
was	1
his	1
scorn	1
of	1
people	1
who	1
omitted	1
them!	1
But	1
Irene	1
could	1
be	1
imagined,	1
like	1
some	1
nymph,	1
bathing	1
in	1
wayside	1
streams,	1
for	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
the	1
freshness	1
and	1
of	1
seeing	1
her	1
own	1
fair	1
body.	1
In	1
this	1
conflict	1
throughout	1
the	1
house	1
the	1
woman	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
the	1
wall.	1
As	1
in	1
the	1
struggle	1
between	1
Saxon	1
and	1
Celt	1
still	1
going	1
on	1
within	1
the	1
nation,	1
the	1
more	1
impressionable	1
and	1
receptive	1
temperament	1
had	2
forced	1
on	1
it	1
a	1
conventional	1
superstructure.	1
Thus	1
the	1
house	1
had	1
acquired	1
a	1
close	1
resemblance	1
to	1
hundreds	1
of	1
other	1
houses	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
high	1
aspirations,	1
having	1
become:	1
‘That	1
very	1
charming	1
little	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
Soames	1
Forsytes,	1
quite	1
individual,	1
my	1
dear	1
—	1
really	1
elegant.’	1
For	1
Soames	1
Forsyte	1
—	1
read	1
James	1
Peabody,	1
Thomas	1
Atkins,	1
or	1
Emmanuel	1
Spagnoletti,	1
the	1
name	1
in	1
fact	1
of	1
any	1
upper-middle	1
class	1
Englishman	1
in	1
London	1
with	1
any	1
pretensions	1
to	1
taste;	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
decoration	1
be	1
different,	1
the	1
phrase	1
is	1
just.	1
On	1
the	1
evening	1
of	1
August	1
8,	1
a	1
week	1
after	1
the	1
expedition	1
to	1
Robin	1
Hill,	1
in	1
the	1
dining-room	1
of	1
this	1
house	1
—‘quite	1
individual,	1
my	1
dear	1
—	1
really	1
elegant’—	1
Soames	1
and	1
Irene	1
were	1
seated	1
at	1
dinner.	1
A	1
hot	1
dinner	1
on	1
Sundays	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
distinguishing	1
elegance	1
common	1
to	1
this	1
house	1
and	1
many	1
others.	1
Early	1
in	1
married	1
life	1
Soames	1
had	1
laid	1
down	1
the	1
rule:	1
‘The	1
servants	1
must	1
give	1
us	1
hot	1
dinner	1
on	1
Sundays	1
—	1
they’ve	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
but	1
play	1
the	1
concertina.’	1
The	1
custom	1
had	1
produced	1
no	1
revolution.	1
For	1
—	1
to	1
Soames	1
a	1
rather	1
deplorable	1
sign	1
—	1
servants	1
were	1
devoted	1
to	1
Irene,	1
who,	1
in	1
defiance	1
of	1
all	1
safe	1
tradition,	1
appeared	1
to	1
recognise	1
their	1
right	1
to	1
a	1
share	1
in	1
the	1
weaknesses	1
of	1
human	1
nature.	1
The	1
happy	1
pair	1
were	1
seated,	1
not	1
opposite	1
each	1
other,	1
but	1
rectangularly,	1
at	1
the	1
handsome	1
rosewood	1
table;	1
they	1
dined	1
without	1
a	1
cloth	1
—	1
a	1
distinguishing	1
elegance	1
—	1
and	1
so	1
far	1
had	1
not	1
spoken	1
a	1
word.	1
Soames	1
liked	1
to	1
talk	1
during	1
dinner	1
about	1
business,	1
or	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
buying,	1
and	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
talked	1
Irene’s	1
silence	1
did	1
not	1
distress	1
him.	1
This	1
evening	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
it	1
impossible	1
to	1
talk.	1
The	1
decision	1
to	1
build	1
had	1
been	1
weighing	1
on	1
his	1
mind	1
all	1
the	1
week,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
tell	1
her.	1
His	1
nervousness	1
about	1
this	1
disclosure	1
irritated	1
him	1
profoundly;	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
business	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
feel	1
like	1
that	1
—	1
a	1
wife	1
and	1
a	1
husband	1
being	1
one	1
person.	1
She	1
had	1
not	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
once	1
since	1
they	1
sat	1
down;	1
and	1
he	1
wondered	1
what	1
on	1
earth	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
thinking	1
about	1
all	1
the	1
time.	1
It	1
was	1
hard,	1
when	1
a	1
man	1
worked	1
as	1
he	1
did,	1
making	1
money	1
for	1
her	1
—	1
yes,	1
and	1
with	1
an	1
ache	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
—	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
sit	1
there,	1
looking	1
—	1
looking	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
saw	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
closing	1
in.	1
It	1
was	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
man	1
get	1
up	1
and	1
leave	1
the	1
table.	1
The	1
light	1
from	1
the	1
rose-shaded	1
lamp	1
fell	1
on	1
her	1
neck	1
and	1
arms	1
—	1
Soames	1
liked	1
her	1
to	1
dine	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
dress,	1
it	1
gave	1
him	1
an	1
inexpressible	1
feeling	1
of	1
superiority	1
to	1
the	1
majority	1
of	1
his	1
acquaintance,	1
whose	1
wives	1
were	1
contented	1
with	1
their	1
best	1
high	1
frocks	1
or	1
with	1
tea-gowns,	1
when	1
they	1
dined	1
at	1
home.	1
Under	1
that	1
rosy	1
light	1
her	1
amber-coloured	1
hair	1
and	1
fair	1
skin	1
made	1
strange	1
contrast	1
with	1
her	1
dark	1
brown	1
eyes.	1
Could	1
a	1
man	1
own	1
anything	1
prettier	1
than	1
this	1
dining-table	1
with	1
its	1
deep	1
tints,	1
the	1
starry,	1
soft-petalled	1
roses,	1
the	1
ruby-coloured	1
glass,	1
and	1
quaint	1
silver	1
furnishing;	1
could	1
a	1
man	1
own	1
anything	1
prettier	1
than	1
the	1
woman	1
who	1
sat	1
at	1
it?	1
Gratitude	1
was	1
no	1
virtue	1
among	1
Forsytes,	1
who,	1
competitive,	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
common-sense,	1
had	1
no	1
occasion	1
for	1
it;	1
and	1
Soames	1
only	1
experienced	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
exasperation	1
amounting	1
to	1
pain,	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
own	1
her	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
right	1
to	1
own	1
her,	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not,	1
as	1
by	1
stretching	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
that	1
rose,	1
pluck	1
her	1
and	1
sniff	1
the	1
very	1
secrets	1
of	1
her	1
heart.	1
Out	1
of	1
his	1
other	1
property,	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
he	1
had	1
collected,	1
his	1
silver,	1
his	1
pictures,	1
his	1
houses,	1
his	1
investments,	1
he	1
got	1
a	1
secret	1
and	1
intimate	1
feeling;	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
he	1
got	1
none.	1
In	1
this	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
there	1
was	1
writing	1
on	1
every	1
wall.	1
His	1
business-like	1
temperament	1
protested	1
against	1
a	1
mysterious	1
warning	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
made	1
for	1
him.	1
He	1
had	1
married	1
this	1
woman,	1
conquered	1
her,	1
made	1
her	1
his	1
own,	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
fundamental	1
of	1
all	1
laws,	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
possession,	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
do	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
own	1
her	1
body	1
—	1
if	1
indeed	1
he	1
could	1
do	1
that,	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
doubt.	1
If	1
any	1
one	1
had	1
asked	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
own	1
her	1
soul,	1
the	1
question	1
would	1
have	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
both	1
ridiculous	1
and	1
sentimental.	1
But	1
he	1
did	1
so	1
want,	1
and	1
the	1
writing	1
said	1
he	1
never	1
would.	1
She	1
was	1
ever	1
silent,	1
passive,	1
gracefully	1
averse;	1
as	1
though	1
terrified	1
lest	1
by	1
word,	1
motion,	1
or	1
sign	1
she	1
might	1
lead	1
him	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
fond	1
of	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
asked	1
himself:	1
Must	1
I	1
always	1
go	1
on	1
like	1
this?	1
Like	1
most	1
novel	1
readers	1
of	1
his	1
generation	1
(and	1
Soames	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
novel	1
reader),	1
literature	1
coloured	1
his	1
view	1
of	1
life;	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
imbibed	1
the	1
belief	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
time.	1
In	1
the	1
end	1
the	1
husband	1
always	1
gained	1
the	1
affection	1
of	1
his	1
wife.	1
Even	1
in	1
those	1
cases	1
—	1
a	1
class	1
of	1
book	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
—	1
which	1
ended	1
in	1
tragedy,	1
the	1
wife	1
always	1
died	1
with	1
poignant	1
regrets	1
on	1
her	1
lips,	1
or	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
husband	1
who	1
died	1
—	1
unpleasant	1
thought	1
—	1
threw	1
herself	1
on	1
his	1
body	1
in	1
an	1
agony	1
of	1
remorse.	1
He	1
often	1
took	1
Irene	1
to	1
the	1
theatre,	1
instinctively	1
choosing	1
the	1
modern	1
Society	1
Plays	1
with	1
the	1
modern	1
Society	1
conjugal	1
problem,	1
so	1
fortunately	1
different	1
from	1
any	1
conjugal	1
problem	1
in	1
real	1
life.	1
He	1
found	1
that	1
they	1
too	1
always	1
ended	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way,	1
even	1
when	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
lover	1
in	1
the	1
case.	1
While	1
he	1
was	1
watching	1
the	1
play	1
Soames	1
often	1
sympathized	1
with	1
the	1
lover;	1
but	1
before	1
he	1
reached	1
home	1
again,	1
driving	1
with	1
Irene	1
in	1
a	1
hansom,	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
this	1
would	1
not	1
do,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
glad	1
the	1
play	1
had	1
ended	1
as	1
it	1
had.	1
There	1
was	1
one	1
class	1
of	1
husband	1
that	1
had	1
just	1
then	1
come	1
into	1
fashion,	1
the	1
strong,	1
rather	1
rough,	1
but	1
extremely	1
sound	1
man,	1
who	1
was	1
peculiarly	1
successful	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
play;	1
with	1
this	1
person	1
Soames	1
was	1
really	1
not	1
in	1
sympathy,	1
and	1
had	1
it	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
position,	1
would	1
have	1
expressed	1
his	1
disgust	1
with	1
the	1
fellow.	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
conscious	1
of	1
how	1
vital	1
to	1
himself	1
was	1
the	1
necessity	1
for	1
being	1
a	1
successful,	1
even	1
a	1
‘strong,’	1
husband,	1
that	1
he	1
never	1
spoke	1
of	1
a	1
distaste	1
born	1
perhaps	1
by	1
the	1
perverse	1
processes	1
of	1
Nature	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
secret	1
fund	1
of	1
brutality	1
in	1
himself.	1
But	1
Irene’s	1
silence	1
this	1
evening	1
was	1
exceptional.	1
He	1
had	1
never	1
before	1
seen	1
such	1
an	1
expression	1
on	1
her	1
face.	1
And	1
since	1
it	1
is	1
always	1
the	1
unusual	1
which	1
alarms,	1
Soames	1
was	1
alarmed.	1
He	1
ate	1
his	1
savoury,	1
and	1
hurried	1
the	1
maid	1
as	1
she	1
swept	1
off	1
the	1
crumbs	1
with	1
the	1
silver	1
sweeper.	1
When	1
she	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
room,	1
he	1
filled	1
his	1
glass	1
with	1
wine	1
and	1
said:	1
“Anybody	1
been	1
here	1
this	1
afternoon?”	1
“June.”	1
“What	1
did	1
she	1
want?”	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
axiom	1
with	1
the	1
Forsytes	1
that	1
people	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
anywhere	1
unless	1
they	1
wanted	1
something.	1
“Came	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
her	1
lover,	1
I	1
suppose?”	1
Irene	1
made	1
no	1
reply.	1
“It	1
looks	1
to	1
me,”	1
continued	1
Soames,	1
“as	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
sweeter	1
on	1
him	1
than	1
he	1
is	1
on	1
her.	1
She’s	1
always	1
following	1
him	1
about.”	1
Irene’s	1
eyes	1
made	1
him	1
feel	1
uncomfortable.	1
“You’ve	1
no	1
business	1
to	1
say	1
such	1
a	1
thing!”	1
she	1
exclaimed.	1
“Why	1
not?	1
Anybody	1
can	1
see	1
it.”	1
“They	1
cannot.	1
And	1
if	1
they	1
could,	1
it’s	1
disgraceful	1
to	1
say	1
so.”	1
Soames’s	1
composure	1
gave	1
way.	1
“You’re	1
a	1
pretty	1
wife!”	1
he	1
said.	1
But	1
secretly	1
he	1
wondered	1
at	1
the	1
heat	1
of	1
her	1
reply;	1
it	1
was	1
unlike	1
her.	1
“You’re	1
cracked	1
about	1
June!	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you	1
one	1
thing:	1
now	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
the	1
Buccaneer	1
in	1
tow,	1
she	1
doesn’t	1
care	1
twopence	1
about	1
you,	1
and,	1
you’ll	1
find	1
it	1
out.	1
But	1
you	1
won’t	1
see	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
her	1
in	1
future;	1
we’re	1
going	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
country.”	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
glad	1
to	1
get	1
his	1
news	1
out	1
under	1
cover	1
of	1
this	1
burst	1
of	1
irritation.	1
He	1
had	1
expected	1
a	1
cry	1
of	1
dismay;	1
the	1
silence	1
with	1
which	1
his	1
pronouncement	1
was	1
received	1
alarmed	1
him.	1
“You	1
don’t	1
seem	1
interested,”	1
he	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
add.	1
“I	1
knew	1
it	1
already.”	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
sharply.	1
“Who	1
told	1
you?”	1
“June.”	1
“How	1
did	1
she	1
know?”	1
Irene	1
did	1
not	1
answer.	1
Baffled	1
and	1
uncomfortable,	1
he	1
said:	1
“It’s	1
a	1
fine	1
thing	1
for	1
Bosinney,	1
it’ll	1
be	1
the	1
making	1
of	1
him.	1
I	1
suppose	1
she’s	1
told	1
you	1
all	1
about	1
it?”	1
“Yes.”	1
There	1
was	1
another	1
pause,	1
and	1
then	1
Soames	1
said:	1
“I	1
suppose	1
you	1
don’t	1
want	1
to,	1
go?”	1
Irene	1
made	1
no	1
reply.	1
“Well,	1
I	1
can’t	1
tell	1
what	1
you	1
want.	1
You	1
never	1
seem	1
contented	1
here.”	1
“Have	1
my	1
wishes	1
anything	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
it?”	1
She	1
took	1
the	1
vase	1
of	1
roses	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
Soames	1
remained	1
seated.	1
Was	1
it	1
for	1
this	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
signed	1
that	1
contract?	1
Was	1
it	1
for	1
this	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
spend	1
some	1
ten	1
thousand	1
pounds?	1
Bosinney’s	1
phrase	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
him:	1
“Women	1
are	1
the	1
devil!”	1
But	1
presently	1
he	1
grew	1
calmer.	1
It	1
might	1
have,	1
been	1
worse.	1
She	1
might	1
have	1
flared	1
up.	1
He	1
had	1
expected	1
something	1
more	1
than	1
this.	1
It	1
was	1
lucky,	1
after	1
all,	1
that	1
June	1
had	1
broken	1
the	1
ice	1
for	1
him.	1
She	1
must	1
have	1
wormed	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
Bosinney;	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
known	1
she	1
would.	1
He	1
lighted	1
his	1
cigarette.	1
After	1
all,	1
Irene	1
had	1
not	1
made	1
a	1
scene!	1
She	1
would	1
come	1
round	1
—	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
her;	1
she	1
was	1
cold,	1
but	1
not	1
sulky.	1
And,	1
puffing	1
the	1
cigarette	1
smoke	1
at	1
a	1
lady-bird	1
on	1
the	1
shining	1
table,	1
he	1
plunged	1
into	1
a	1
reverie	1
about	1
the	1
house.	1
It	1
was	1
no	1
good	1
worrying;	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
and	1
make	1
it	1
up	1
presently.	1
She	1
would	1
be	1
sitting	1
out	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
dark,	1
under	1
the	1
Japanese	1
sunshade,	1
knitting.	1
A	1
beautiful,	1
warm	1
night.	1
.	3
In	1
truth,	1
June	1
had	1
come	1
in	1
that	1
afternoon	1
with	1
shining	1
eyes,	1
and	1
the	1
words:	1
“Soames	1
is	1
a	1
brick!	1
It’s	1
splendid	1
for	1
Phil	1
—	1
the	1
very	1
thing	1
for	1
him!”	1
Irene’s	1
face	1
remaining	1
dark	1
and	1
puzzled,	1
she	1
went	1
on:	1
“Your	1
new	1
house	1
at	1
Robin	1
Hill,	1
of	1
course.	1
What?	1
Don’t	1
you	1
know?”	1
Irene	1
did	1
not	1
know.	1
“Oh!	1
then,	1
I	1
suppose	1
I	1
oughtn’t	1
to	1
have	1
told	1
you!”	1
Looking	1
impatiently	1
at	1
her	1
friend,	1
she	1
cried:	1
“You	1
look	1
as	1
if	1
you	1
didn’t	1
care.	1
Don’t	1
you	1
see,	1
it’s	1
what	1
I’ve’	1
been	1
praying	1
for	1
—	1
the	1
very	1
chance	1
he’s	1
been	1
wanting	1
all	1
this	1
time.	1
Now	1
you’ll	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
can	1
do;”	1
and	1
thereupon	1
she	1
poured	1
out	1
the	1
whole	1
story.	1
Since	1
her	1
own	1
engagement	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
seemed	1
much	1
interested	1
in	1
her	1
friend’s	1
position;	1
the	1
hours	1
she	1
spent	1
with	1
Irene	1
were	1
given	1
to	1
confidences	1
of	1
her	1
own;	1
and	1
at	1
times,	1
for	1
all	1
her	1
affectionate	1
pity,	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
keep	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
smile	1
a	1
trace	1
of	1
compassionate	1
contempt	1
for	1
the	1
woman	1
who	1
had	1
made	1
such	1
a	1
mistake	1
in	1
her	1
life	1
—	1
such	1
a	1
vast,	1
ridiculous	1
mistake.	1
“He’s	1
to	1
have	1
all	1
the	1
decorations	1
as	1
well	1
—	1
a	1
free	1
hand.	1
It’s	1
perfect	1
—”	1
June	1
broke	1
into	1
laughter,	1
her	1
little	1
figure	1
quivered	1
gleefully;	1
she	1
raised	1
her	1
hand,	1
and	1
struck	1
a	1
blow	1
at	1
a	1
muslin	1
curtain.	1
“Do	1
you,	1
know	1
I	1
even	1
asked	1
Uncle	1
James.	1
.	3
”	1
But,	1
with	1
a	1
sudden	1
dislike	1
to	1
mentioning	1
that	1
incident,	1
she	1
stopped;	1
and	1
presently,	1
finding	1
her	1
friend	1
so	1
unresponsive,	1
went	1
away.	1
She	1
looked	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
pavement,	1
and	1
Irene	1
was	1
still	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
doorway.	1
In	1
response	1
to	1
her	1
farewell	1
wave,	1
Irene	1
put	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
her	1
brow,	1
and,	1
turning	1
slowly,	1
shut	1
the	1
door.	1
.	3
Soames	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
presently,	1
and	1
peered	1
at	1
her	1
through	1
the	1
window.	1
Out	1
in	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
the	1
Japanese	1
sunshade	1
she	1
was	1
sitting	1
very	1
still,	1
the	1
lace	1
on	1
her	1
white	1
shoulders	1
stirring	1
with	1
the	1
soft	1
rise	1
and	1
fall	1
of	1
her	1
bosom.	1
But	1
about	1
this	1
silent	1
creature	1
sitting	1
there	1
so	1
motionless,	1
in	1
the	1
dark,	1
there	1
seemed	1
a	1
warmth,	1
a	1
hidden	1
fervour	1
of	1
feeling,	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
her	1
being	1
had	1
been	1
stirred,	1
and	1
some	1
change	1
were	1
taking	1
place	1
in	1
its	1
very	1
depths.	1
He	1
stole	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
dining-room	1
unnoticed.	1
Chapter	1
6	1
James	1
at	1
Large	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
long	1
before	1
Soames’s	1
determination	1
to	1
build	1
went	1
the	1
round	1
of	1
the	1
family,	1
and	1
created	1
the	1
flutter	1
that	1
any	1
decision	1
connected	1
with	1
property	1
should	1
make	1
among	1
Forsytes.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
his	1
fault,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
determined	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
should	1
know.	1
June,	1
in	1
the	1
fulness	1
of	1
her	1
heart,	1
had	1
told	1
Mrs.	1
Small,	1
giving	1
her	1
leave	1
only	1
to	1
tell	1
Aunt	1
Ann	1
—	1
she	1
thought	1
it	1
would	1
cheer	1
her,	1
the	1
poor	1
old	1
sweet!	1
for	1
Aunt	1
Ann	1
had	1
kept	1
her	1
room	1
now	1
for	1
many	1
days.	1
Mrs.	1
Small	1
told	1
Aunt	1
Ann	1
at	1
once,	1
who,	1
smiling	1
as	1
she	1
lay	1
back	1
on	1
her	1
pillows,	1
said	1
in	1
her	1
distinct,	1
trembling	1
old	1
voice:	1
“It’s	1
very	1
nice	1
for	1
dear	1
June;	1
but	1
I	1
hope	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
careful	1
—	1
it’s	1
rather	1
dangerous!”	1
When	1
she	1
was	1
left	1
alone	1
again,	1
a	1
frown,	1
like	1
a	1
cloud	1
presaging	1
a	1
rainy	1
morrow,	1
crossed	1
her	1
face.	1
While	1
she	1
was	1
lying	1
there	1
so	1
many	1
days	1
the	1
process	1
of	1
recharging	1
her	1
will	1
went	1
on	1
all	1
the	1
time;	1
it	1
spread	1
to	1
her	1
face,	1
too,	1
and	1
tightening	1
movements	1
were	1
always	1
in	1
action	1
at	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
her	1
lips.	1
The	1
maid	1
Smither,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
her	1
service	1
since	1
girlhood,	1
and	1
was	1
spoken	1
of	1
as	1
“Smither	1
—	1
a	1
good	1
girl	1
—	1
but	1
so	1
slow!”—	1
the	1
maid	1
Smither	1
performed	1
every	1
morning	1
with	1
extreme	1
punctiliousness	1
the	1
crowning	1
ceremony	1
of	1
that	1
ancient	1
toilet.	1
Taking	1
from	1
the	1
recesses	1
of	1
their	1
pure	1
white	1
band-box	1
those	1
flat,	1
grey	1
curls,	1
the	1
insignia	1
of	1
personal	1
dignity,	1
she	1
placed	1
them	1
securely	1
in	1
her	1
mistress’s	1
hands,	1
and	1
turned	1
her	1
back.	1
And	1
every	1
day	1
Aunts	1
Juley	1
and	1
Hester	1
were	1
required	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
report	1
on	1
Timothy;	1
what	1
news	1
there	1
was	1
of	1
Nicholas;	1
whether	1
dear	1
June	1
had	1
succeeded	1
in	1
getting	1
Jolyon	1
to	1
shorten	1
the	1
engagement,	1
now	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Bosinney	1
was	1
building	1
Soames	1
a	1
house;	1
whether	1
young	1
Roger’s	1
wife	1
was	1
really	1
—	1
expecting;	1
how	1
the	1
operation	1
on	1
Archie	1
had	1
succeeded;	1
and	1
what	1
Swithin	1
had	1
done	1
about	1
that	1
empty	1
house	1
in	1
Wigmore	1
Street,	1
where	1
the	1
tenant	1
had	1
lost	1
all	1
his	1
money	1
and	1
treated	1
him	1
so	1
badly;	1
above	1
all,	1
about	1
Soames;	1
was	1
Irene	1
still	1
—	1
still	1
asking	1
for	1
a	1
separate	1
room?	1
And	1
every	1
morning	1
Smither	1
was	1
told:	1
“I	1
shall	1
be	1
coming	1
down	1
this	1
afternoon,	1
Smither,	1
about	1
two	1
o’clock.	1
I	1
shall	1
want	1
your	1
arm,	1
after	1
all	1
these	1
days	1
in	1
bed!”	1
After	1
telling	1
Aunt	1
Ann,	1
Mrs.	1
Small	1
had	1
spoken	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
strictest	1
confidence	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Nicholas,	1
who	1
in	1
her	1
turn	1
had	1
asked	1
Winifred	1
Dartie	1
for	1
confirmation,	1
supposing,	1
of	1
course,	1
that,	1
being	1
Soames’s	1
sister,	1
she	1
would	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
it.	1
Through	1
her	1
it	1
had	1
in	1
due	1
course	1
come	1
round	1
to	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
James.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
agitated.	1
“Nobody,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“told	1
him	1
anything.”	1
And,	1
rather	1
than	1
go	1
direct	1
to	1
Soames	1
himself,	1
of	1
whose	1
taciturnity	1
he	1
was	1
afraid,	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
umbrella	1
and	1
went	1
round	1
to	1
Timothy’s.	1
He	1
found	1
Mrs.	1
Septimus	1
and	1
Hester	1
(who	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
—	1
she	1
was	1
so	1
safe,	1
she	1
found	1
it	1
tiring	1
to	1
talk)	1
ready,	1
and	1
indeed	1
eager,	1
to	1
discuss	1
the	1
news.	1
It	1
was	1
very	1
good	1
of	1
dear	1
Soames,	1
they	1
thought,	1
to	1
employ	1
Mr.	1
Bosinney,	1
but	1
rather	1
risky.	1
What	1
had	1
George	1
named	1
him?	1
‘The	1
Buccaneer’	1
How	1
droll!	1
But	1
George	1
was	1
always	1
droll!	1
However,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
family	1
they	1
supposed	1
they	1
must	1
really	1
look	1
upon	1
Mr.	1
Bosinney	1
as	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
family,	1
though	1
it	1
seemed	1
strange.	1
James	1
here	1
broke	1
in:	1
“Nobody	1
knows	1
anything	1
about	1
him.	1
I	1
don’t	1
see	1
what	1
Soames	1
wants	1
with	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
like	1
that.	1
I	1
shouldn’t	1
be	1
surprised	1
if	1
Irene	1
had	1
put	1
her	1
oar	1
in.	1
I	1
shall	1
speak	1
to.	1
.	3
”	1
“Soames,”	1
interposed	1
Aunt	1
Juley,	1
“told	1
Mr.	1
Bosinney	1
that	1
he	1
didn’t	1
wish	1
it	1
mentioned.	1
He	1
wouldn’t	1
like	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
talked	1
about,	1
I’m	1
sure,	1
and	1
if	1
Timothy	1
knew	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
very	1
vexed,	1
I.	1
.	3
”	1
James	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
behind	1
his	1
ear:	1
“What?”	1
he	1
said.	1
“I’m	1
getting	1
very	1
deaf.	1
I	1
suppose	1
I	1
don’t	1
hear	1
people.	1
Emily’s	1
got	1
a	1
bad	1
toe.	1
We	1
shan’t	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
start	1
for	1
Wales	1
till	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
month.	1
There’	1
s	1
always	1
something!”	1
And,	1
having	1
got	1
what	1
he	1
wanted,	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
hat	1
and	1
went	1
away.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
fine	1
afternoon,	1
and	1
he	1
walked	1
across	1
the	1
Park	1
towards	1
Soames’s,	1
where	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
dine,	1
for	1
Emily’s	1
toe	1
kept	1
her	1
in	1
bed,	1
and	1
Rachel	1
and	1
Cicely	1
were	1
on	1
a	1
visit	1
to	1
the	1
country.	1
He	1
took	1
the	1
slanting	1
path	1
from	1
the	1
Bayswater	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
Row	1
to	1
the	1
Knightsbridge	1
Gate,	1
across	1
a	1
pasture	1
of	1
short,	1
burnt	1
grass,	1
dotted	1
with	1
blackened	1
sheep,	1
strewn	1
with	1
seated	1
couples	1
and	1
strange	1
waifs;	1
lying	1
prone	1
on	1
their	1
faces,	1
like	1
corpses	1
on	1
a	1
field	1
over	1
which	1
the	1
wave	1
of	1
battle	1
has	1
rolled.	1
He	1
walked	1
rapidly,	1
his	1
head	1
bent,	1
looking	1
neither	1
to	1
right	1
nor,	1
left.	1
The	1
appearance	1
of	1
this	1
park,	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
battle-field,	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
all	1
his	1
life	1
been	1
fighting,	1
excited	1
no	1
thought	1
or	1
speculation	1
in	1
his	1
mind.	1
These	1
corpses	1
flung	1
down,	1
there,	1
from	1
out	1
the	1
press	1
and	1
turmoil	1
of	1
the	1
struggle,	1
these	1
pairs	1
of	1
lovers	1
sitting	1
cheek	1
by	1
jowl	1
for	1
an	1
hour	1
of	1
idle	1
Elysium	1
snatched	1
from	1
the	1
monotony	1
of	1
their	1
treadmill,	1
awakened	1
no	1
fancies	1
in	1
his	1
mind;	1
he	1
had	1
outlived	1
that	1
kind	1
of	1
imagination;	1
his	1
nose,	1
like	1
the	1
nose	1
of	1
a	1
sheep,	1
was	1
fastened	1
to	1
the	1
pastures	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
browsed.	1
One	1
of	1
his	1
tenants	1
had	1
lately	1
shown	1
a	1
disposition	1
to	1
be	1
behind-hand	1
in	1
his	1
rent,	1
and	1
it	1
had	1
become	1
a	1
grave	1
question	1
whether	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
better	1
turn	1
him	1
out	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
so	1
run	1
the	1
risk	1
of	1
not	1
re-letting	1
before	1
Christmas.	1
Swithin	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
let	1
in	1
very	1
badly,	1
but	1
it	1
had	1
served	1
him	1
right	1
—	1
he	1
had	1
held	1
on	1
too	1
long.	1
He	1
pondered	1
this	1
as	1
he	1
walked	1
steadily,	1
holding	1
his	1
umbrella	1
carefully	1
by	1
the	1
wood,	1
just	1
below	1
the	1
crook	1
of	1
the	1
handle,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
ferule	1
off	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
not	1
fray	1
the	1
silk	1
in	1
the	1
middle.	1
And,	1
with	1
his	1
thin,	1
high	1
shoulders	1
stooped,	1
his	1
long	1
legs	1
moving	1
with	1
swift	1
mechanical	1
precision,	1
this	1
passage	1
through	1
the	1
Park,	1
where	1
the	1
sun	1
shone	1
with	1
a	1
clear	1
flame	1
on	1
so	1
much	1
idleness	1
—	1
on	1
so	1
many	1
human	1
evidences	1
of	1
the	1
remorseless	1
battle	1
of	1
Property,	1
raging	1
beyond	1
its	1
ring	1
—	1
was	1
like	1
the	1
flight	1
of	1
some	1
land	1
bird	1
across	1
the	1
sea.	1
He	1
felt	1
a	1
—	1
touch	1
on	1
the	1
arm	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
at	1
Albert	1
Gate.	1
It	1
was	1
Soames,	1
who,	1
crossing	1
from	1
the	1
shady	1
side	1
of	1
Piccadilly,	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
walking	1
home	1
from	1
the	1
office,	1
had	1
suddenly	1
appeared	1
alongside.	1
“Your	1
mother’s	1
in	1
bed,”	1
said	1
James;	1
“I	1
was,	1
just	1
coming	1
to	1
you,	1
but	1
I	1
suppose	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
way.”	1
The	1
outward	1
relations	1
between	1
James	1
and	1
his	1
son	1
were	1
marked	1
by	1
a	1
lack	1
of	1
sentiment	1
peculiarly	1
Forsytean,	1
but	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
two	1
were	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
unattached.	1
Perhaps	1
they	1
regarded	1
one	1
another	1
as	1
an	1
investment;	1
certainly	1
they	1
were	1
solicitous	1
of	1
each	1
other’s	1
welfare,	1
glad	1
of	1
each	1
other’s	1
company.	1
They	1
had	1
never	1
exchanged	1
two	1
words	1
upon	1
the	1
more	1
intimate	1
problems	1
of	1
life,	1
or	1
revealed	1
in	1
each	1
other’s	1
presence	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
any	1
deep	1
feeling.	1
Something	1
beyond	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
word-analysis	1
bound	1
them	1
together,	1
something	1
hidden	1
deep	1
in	1
the	1
fibre	1
of	1
nations	1
and	1
families	1
—	1
for	1
blood,	1
they	1
say,	1
is	1
thicker	1
than	1
water	1
—	1
and	1
neither	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
a	1
cold-blooded	1
man.	1
Indeed,	1
in	1
James	1
love	1
of	1
his	1
children	1
was	1
now	1
the	1
prime	1
motive	1
of	1
his	1
existence.	1
To	1
have	1
creatures	1
who	1
were	1
parts	1
of	1
himself,	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
might	1
transmit	1
the	1
money	1
he	1
saved,	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
root	1
of	1
his	1
saving;	1
and,	1
at	1
seventy-five,	1
what	1
was	1
left	1
that	1
could	1
give	1
him	1
pleasure,	1
but	1
—	1
saving?	1
The	1
kernel	1
of	1
life	1
was	1
in	1
this	1
saving	1
for	1
his	1
children.	1
Than	1
James	1
Forsyte,	1
notwithstanding	1
all	1
his	1
‘Jonah-isms,’	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
saner	1
man	1
(if	1
the	1
leading	1
symptom	1
of	1
sanity,	1
as	1
we	1
are	1
told,	1
is	1
self-preservation,	1
though	1
without	1
doubt	1
Timothy	1
went	1
too	1
far)	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
London,	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
owned	1
so	1
much,	1
and	1
loved	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
dumb	1
love,	1
as	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
his	1
opportunities.	1
He	1
had	1
the	1
marvellous	1
instinctive	1
sanity	1
of	1
the	1
middle	1
class.	1
In	1
him	1
—	1
more	1
than	1
in	1
Jolyon,	1
with	1
his	1
masterful	1
will	1
and	1
his	1
moments	1
of	1
tenderness	1
and	1
philosophy	1
—	1
more	1
than	1
in	1
Swithin,	1
the	1
martyr	1
to	1
crankiness	1
—	1
Nicholas,	1
the	1
sufferer	1
from	1
ability	1
—	1
and	1
Roger,	1
the	1
victim	1
of	1
enterprise	1
—	1
beat	1
the	1
true	1
pulse	1
of	1
compromise;	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
brothers	1
he	1
was	1
least	1
remarkable	1
in	1
mind	1
and	1
person,	1
and	1
for	1
that	1
reason	1
more	1
likely	1
to	1
live	1
for	1
ever.	1
To	1
James,	1
more	1
than	1
to	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
others,	1
was	1
“the	1
family”	1
significant	1
and	1
dear.	1
There	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
something	1
primitive	1
and	1
cosy	1
in	1
his	1
attitude	1
towards	1
life;	1
he	1
loved	1
the	1
family	1
hearth,	1
he	1
loved	1
gossip,	1
and	1
he	1
loved	1
grumbling.	1
All	1
his	1
decisions	1
were	1
formed	1
of	1
a	1
cream	1
which	1
he	1
skimmed	1
off	1
the	1
family	1
mind;	1
and,	1
through	1
that	1
family,	1
off	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
thousands	1
of	1
other	1
families	1
of	1
similar	1
fibre.	1
Year	1
after	1
year,	1
week	1
after	1
week,	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
Timothy’s,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
brother’s	1
front	1
drawing-room	1
—	1
his	1
legs	1
twisted,	1
his	1
long	1
white	1
whiskers	1
framing	1
his	1
clean-shaven	1
mouth	1
—	1
would	1
sit	1
watching	1
the	1
family	1
pot	1
simmer,	1
the	1
cream	1
rising	1
to	1
the	1
top;	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
away	1
sheltered,	1
refreshed,	1
comforted,	1
with	1
an	1
indefinable	1
sense	1
of	1
comfort.	1
Beneath	1
the	1
adamant	1
of	1
his	1
self-preserving	1
instinct	1
there	1
was	1
much	1
real	1
softness	1
in	1
James;	1
a	1
visit	1
to	1
Timothy’s	1
was	1
like	1
an	1
hour	1
spent	1
in	1
the	1
lap	1
of	1
a	1
mother;	1
and	1
the	1
deep	1
craving	1
he	1
himself	1
had	1
for	1
the	1
protection	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
wing	1
reacted	1
in	1
turn	1
on	1
his	1
feelings	1
towards	1
his	1
own	1
children;	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
nightmare	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
them	1
exposed	1
to	1
the	1
treatment	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
in	1
money,	1
health,	1
or	1
reputation.	1
When	1
his	1
old	1
friend	1
John	1
Street’s	1
son	1
volunteered	1
for	1
special	1
service,	1
he	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
querulously,	1
and	1
wondered	1
what	1
John	1
Street	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
allow	1
it;	1
and	1
when	1
young	1
Street	1
was	1
assagaied,	1
he	1
took	1
it	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
heart	1
that	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
point	1
of	1
calling	1
everywhere	1
with	1
the	1
special	1
object	1
of	1
saying:	1
He	1
knew	1
how	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
—	1
he’d	1
no	1
patience	1
with	1
them!	1
When	1
his	1
son-in-law	1
Dartie	1
had	1
that	1
financial	1
crisis,	1
due	1
to	1
speculation	1
in	1
Oil	1
Shares,	1
James	1
made	1
himself	1
ill	1
worrying	1
over	1
it;	1
the	1
knell	1
of	1
all	1
prosperity	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
sounded.	1
It	1
took	1
him	1
three	1
months	1
and	1
a	1
visit	1
to	1
Baden-Baden	1
to	1
get	1
better;	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
terrible	1
in	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
but	1
for	1
his,	1
James’s,	1
money,	1
Dartie’s	1
name	1
might	1
have	1
appeared	1
in	1
the	1
Bankruptcy	1
List.	1
Composed	1
of	1
a	1
physiological	1
mixture	1
so	1
sound	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
an	1
earache	1
he	1
thought	1
he	1
was	1
dying,	1
he	1
regarded	1
the	1
occasional	1
ailments	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
children	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
personal	1
grievances,	1
special	1
interventions	1
of	1
Providence	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
destroying	1
his	1
peace	1
of	1
mind;	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
at	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
ailments	1
of	1
people	1
outside	1
his	1
own	1
immediate	1
family,	1
affirming	1
them	1
in	1
every	1
case	1
to	1
be	1
due	1
to	1
neglected	1
liver.	1
His	1
universal	1
comment	1
was:	1
“What	1
can	1
they	1
expect?	1
I	1
have	1
it	1
myself,	1
if	1
I’m	1
not	1
careful!”	1
When	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
Soames’s	1
that	1
evening	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
life	1
was	1
hard	1
on	1
him:	1
There	1
was	1
Emily	1
with	1
a	1
bad	1
toe,	1
and	1
Rachel	1
gadding	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
country;	1
he	1
got	1
no	1
sympathy	1
from	1
anybody;	1
and	1
Ann,	1
she	1
was	1
ill	1
—	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
she	1
would	1
last	1
through	1
the	1
summer;	1
he	1
had	1
called	1
there	1
three	1
times	1
now	1
without	1
her	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
see	1
him!	1
And	1
this	1
idea	1
of	1
Soames’s,	1
building	1
a	1
house,	1
that	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
looked	1
into.	1
As	1
to	1
the	1
trouble	1
with	1
Irene,	1
he	1
didn’t	1
know	1
what	1
was	1
to	1
come	1
of	1
that	1
—	1
anything	1
might	1
come	1
of	1
it!	1
He	1
entered	1
62,	1
Montpellier	1
Square	1
with	1
the	1
fullest	1
intentions	1
of	1
being	1
miserable.	1
It	1
was	1
already	1
half-past	1
seven,	1
and	1
Irene,	1
dressed	1
for	1
dinner,	1
was	1
seated	1
in	1
the	1
drawing-room.	1
She	1
was	1
wearing	1
her	1
gold-coloured	1
frock	1
—	1
for,	1
having	1
been	1
displayed	1
at	1
a	1
dinner-party,	1
a	1
soiree,	1
and	1
a	1
dance,	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
to	1
be	1
worn	1
at	1
home	1
—	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
adorned	1
the	1
bosom	1
with	1
a	1
cascade	1
of	1
lace,	1
on	1
which	1
James’s	1
eyes	1
riveted	1
themselves	1
at	1
once.	1
“Where	1
do	1
you	1
get	1
your	1
things?”	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
an	1
aggravated	1
voice.	1
“I	1
never	1
see	1
Rachel	1
and	1
Cicely	1
looking	1
half	1
so	1
well.	1
That	1
rose-point,	1
now	1
—	1
that’s	1
not	1
real!”	1
Irene	1
came	1
close,	1
to	1
prove	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
error.	1
And,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
himself,	1
James	1
felt	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
her	1
deference,	1
of	1
the	1
faint	1
seductive	1
perfume	1
exhaling	1
from	1
her.	1
No	1
self-respecting	1
Forsyte	1
surrendered	1
at	1
a	1
blow;	1
so	1
he	1
merely	1
said:	1
He	1
didn’t	1
know	1
—	1
he	1
expected	1
she	1
was	1
spending	1
a	1
pretty	1
penny	1
on	1
dress.	1
The	1
gong	1
sounded,	1
and,	1
putting	1
her	1
white	1
arm	1
within	1
his,	1
Irene	1
took	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
dining-room.	1
She	1
seated	1
him	1
in	1
Soames’s	1
usual	1
place,	1
round	1
the	1
corner	1
on	1
her	1
left.	1
The	1
light	1
fell	1
softly	1
there,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
worried	1
by	1
the	1
gradual	1
dying	1
of	1
the	1
day;	1
and	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
him	1
about	1
himself.	1
Presently,	1
over	1
James	1
came	1
a	1
change,	1
like	1
the	1
mellowing	1
that	1
steals	1
upon	1
a	1
fruit	1
in	1
the,	1
sun;	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
being	1
caressed,	1
and	1
praised,	1
and	1
petted,	1
and	1
all	1
without	1
the	1
bestowal	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
caress	1
or	1
word	1
of	1
praise.	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
eating	1
was	1
agreeing	1
with	1
him;	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
that	1
feeling	1
at	1
home;	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
enjoyed	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
champagne	1
so	1
much,	1
and,	1
on	1
inquiring	1
the	1
brand	1
and	1
price,	1
was	1
surprised	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
large	1
stock	1
himself,	1
but	1
could	1
never	1
drink;	1
he	1
instantly	1
formed	1
the	1
resolution	1
to	1
let	1
his	1
wine	1
merchant	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
swindled.	1
Looking	1
up	1
from	1
his	1
food,	1
he	1
remarked:	1
“You’ve	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
nice	1
things	1
about	1
the	1
place.	1
Now,	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
give	1
for	1
that	1
sugar-sifter?	1
Shouldn’t	1
wonder	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
worth	1
money!”	1
He	1
was	1
particularly	1
pleased	1
with	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
a	1
picture,	1
on	1
the	1
wall	1
opposite,	1
which	1
he	1
himself	1
had	1
given	1
them:	1
“I’d	1
no	1
idea	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
good!”	1
he	1
said.	1
They	1
rose	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
drawing-room,	1
and	1
James	1
followed	1
Irene	1
closely.	1
“That’s	1
what	1
I	1
call	1
a	1
capital	1
little	1
dinner,”	1
he	1
murmured,	1
breathing	1
pleasantly	1
down	1
on	1
her	1
shoulder;	1
“nothing	1
heavy	1
—	1
and	1
not	1
too	1
Frenchified.	1
But	1
I	1
can’t	1
get	1
it	1
at	1
home.	1
I	1
pay	1
my	1
cook	1
sixty	1
pounds	1
a	1
year,	1
but	1
she	1
can’t	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
dinner	1
like	1
that!”	1
He	1
had	1
as	1
yet	1
made	1
no	1
allusion	1
to	1
the	1
building	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
nor	1
did	1
he	1
when	1
Soames,	1
pleading	1
the	1
excuse	1
of	1
business,	1
betook	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
room	1
at	1
the	1
top,	1
where	1
he	1
kept	1
his	1
pictures.	1
James	1
was	1
left	1
alone	1
with	1
his	1
daughter-in-law.	1
The	1
glow	1
of	1
the	1
wine,	1
and	1
of	1
an	1
excellent	1
liqueur,	1
was	1
still	1
within	1
him.	1
He	1
felt	1
quite	1
warm	1
towards	1
her.	1
She	1
was	1
really	1
a	1
taking	1
little	1
thing;	1
she	1
listened	1
to	1
you,	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
understand	1
what	1
you	1
were	1
saying;	1
and,	1
while	1
talking,	1
he	1
kept	1
examining	1
her	1
figure,	1
from	1
her	1
bronze-coloured	1
shoes	1
to	1
the	1
waved	1
gold	1
of	1
her	1
hair.	1
She	1
was	1
leaning	1
back	1
in	1
an	1
Empire	1
chair,	1
her	1
shoulders	1
poised	1
against	1
the	1
top	1
—	1
her	1
body,	1
flexibly	1
straight	1
and	1
unsupported	1
from	1
the	1
hips,	1
swaying	1
when	1
she	1
moved,	1
as	1
though	1
giving	1
to	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
a	1
lover.	1
Her	1
lips	1
were	1
smiling,	1
her	1
eyes	1
half-closed.	1
It	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
recognition	1
of	1
danger	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
charm	1
of	1
her	1
attitude,	1
or	1
a	1
twang	1
of	1
digestion,	1
that	1
caused	1
a	1
sudden	1
dumbness	1
to	1
fall	1
on	1
James.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
remember	1
ever	1
having	1
been	1
quite	1
alone	1
with	1
Irene	1
before.	1
And,	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
her,	1
an	1
odd	1
feeling	1
crept	1
over	1
him,	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
across	1
something	1
strange	1
and	1
foreign.	1
Now	1
what	1
was	1
she	1
thinking	1
about	1
—	1
sitting	1
back	1
like	1
that?	1
Thus	1
when	1
he	1
spoke	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
sharper	1
voice,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
awakened	1
from	1
a	1
pleasant	1
dream.	1
“What	1
d’you	1
do	1
with	1
yourself	1
all	1
day?”	1
he	1
said.	1
“You	1
never	1
come	1
round	1
to	1
Park	1
Lane!”	1
She	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
making	1
very	1
lame	1
excuses,	1
and	1
James	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
at	1
her.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
really	1
avoiding	1
them	1
—	1
it	1
would	1
mean	1
too	1
much.	1
“I	1
expect	1
the	1
fact	1
is,	1
you	1
haven’t	1
time,”	1
he	1
said;	1
“You’re	1
always	1
about	1
with	1
June.	1
I	1
expect	1
you’re	1
useful	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
her	1
young	1
man,	1
chaperoning,	1
and	1
one	1
thing	1
and	1
another.	1
They	1
tell	1
me	1
she’s	1
never	1
at	1
home	1
now;	1
your	1
Uncle	1
Jolyon	1
he	1
doesn’t	1
like	1
it,	1
I	1
fancy,	1
being	1
left	1
so	1
much	1
alone	1
as	1
he	1
is.	1
They	1
tell	1
me	1
she’s	1
always	1
hanging	1
about	1
for	1
this	1
young	1
Bosinney;	1
I	1
suppose	1
he	1
comes	1
here	1
every	1
day.	1
Now,	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
him?	1
D’you	1
think	1
he	1
knows	1
his	1
own	1
mind?	1
He	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
poor	1
thing.	1
I	1
should	1
say	1
the	1
grey	1
mare	1
was	1
the	1
better	1
horse!”	1
The	1
colour	1
deepened	1
in	1
Irene’s	1
face;	1
and	1
James	1
watched	1
her	1
suspiciously.	1
“Perhaps	1
you	1
don’t	1
quite	1
understand	1
Mr.	1
Bosinney,”	1
she	1
said.	1
“Don’t	1
understand	1
him!”	1
James	1
hummed	1
out:	1
“Why	1
not?	1
—	1
you	1
can	1
see	1
he’s	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
artistic	1
chaps.	1
They	1
say	1
he’s	1
clever	1
—	1
they	1
all	1
think	1
they’re	1
clever.	1
You	1
know	1
more	1
about	1
him	1
than	1
I	1
do,”	1
he	1
added;	1
and	1
again	1
his	1
suspicious	1
glance	1
rested	1
on	1
her.	1
“He	1
is	1
designing	1
a	1
house	1
for	1
Soames,”	1
she	1
said	1
softly,	1
evidently	1
trying	1
to	1
smooth	1
things	1
over.	1
“That	1
brings	1
me	1
to	1
what	1
I	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
say,”	1
continued	1
James;	1
“I	1
don’t	1
know	1
what	1
Soames	1
wants	1
with	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
like	1
that;	1
why	1
doesn’t	1
he	1
go	1
to	1
a	1
first-rate	1
man?”	1
“Perhaps	1
Mr.	1
Bosinney	1
is	1
first-rate!”	1
James	1
rose,	1
and	1
took	1
a	1
turn	1
with	1
bent	1
head.	1
“That’s	1
it’,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“you	1
young	1
people,	1
you	1
all	1
stick	1
together;	1
you	1
all	1
think	1
you	1
know	1
best!”	1
Halting	1
his	1
tall,	1
lank	1
figure	1
before	1
her,	1
he	1
raised	1
a	1
finger,	1
and	1
levelled	1
it	1
at	1
her	1
bosom,	1
as	1
though	1
bringing	1
an	1
indictment	1
against	1
her	1
beauty:	1
“All	1
I	1
can	1
say	1
is,	1
these	1
artistic	1
people,	1
or	1
whatever	1
they	1
call	1
themselves,	1
they’re	1
as	1
unreliable	1
as	1
they	1
can	1
be;	1
and	1
my	1
advice	1
to	1
you	1
is,	1
don’t	1
you	1
have	1
too	1
much	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
him!”	1
Irene	1
smiled;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
curve	1
of	1
her	1
lips	1
was	1
a	1
strange	1
provocation.	1
She	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
lost	1
her	1
deference.	1
Her	1
breast	1
rose	1
and	1
fell	1
as	1
though	1
with	1
secret	1
anger;	1
she	1
drew	1
her	1
hands	1
inwards	1
from	1
their	1
rest	1
on	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
her	1
chair	1
until	1
the	1
tips	1
of	1
her	1
fingers	1
met,	1
and	1
her	1
dark	1
eyes	1
looked	1
unfathomably	1
at	1
James.	1
The	1
latter	1
gloomily	1
scrutinized	1
the	1
floor.	1
“I	1
tell	1
you	1
my	1
opinion,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“it’s	1
a	1
pity	1
you	1
haven’t	1
got	1
a	1
child	1
to	1
think	1
about,	1
and	1
occupy	1
you!”	1
A	1
brooding	1
look	1
came	1
instantly	1
on	1
Irene’s	1
face,	1
and	1
even	1
James	1
became	1
conscious	1
of	1
the	1
rigidity	1
that	1
took	1
possession	1
of	1
her	1
whole	1
figure	1
beneath	1
the	1
softness	1
of	1
its	1
silk	1
and	1
lace	1
clothing.	1
He	1
was	1
frightened	1
by	1
the	1
effect	1
he	1
had	1
produced,	1
and	1
like	1
most	1
men	1
with	1
but	1
little	1
courage,	1
he	1
sought	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
justify	1
himself	1
by	1
bullying.	1
“You	1
don’t	1
seem	1
to	1
care	1
about	1
going	1
about.	1
Why	1
don’t	1
you	1
drive	1
down	1
to	1
Hurlingham	1
with	1
us?	1
And	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
theatre	1
now	1
and	1
then.	1
At	1
your	1
time	1
of	1
life	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
take	1
an	1
interest	1
in	1
things.	1
You’re	1
a	1
young	1
woman!”	1
The	1
brooding	1
look	1
darkened	1
on	1
her	1
face;	1
he	1
grew	1
nervous.	1
“Well,	1
I	1
know	1
nothing	1
about	1
it,”	1
he	1
said;	1
“nobody	1
tells	1
me	1
anything.	1
Soames	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
himself.	1
If	1
he	1
can’t	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
himself	1
he	1
mustn’t	1
look	1
to	1
me	1
—	1
that’s	1
all.”	1
Biting	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
his	1
forefinger	1
he	1
stole	1
a	1
cold,	1
sharp	1
look	1
at	1
his	1
daughter-in-law.	1
He	1
encountered	1
her	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
his	1
own,	1
so	1
dark	1
and	1
deep,	1
that	1
he	1
stopped,	1
and	1
broke	1
into	1
a	1
gentle	1
perspiration.	1
“Well,	1
I	1
must	1
be	1
going,”	1
he	1
said	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
pause,	1
and	1
a	1
minute	1
later	1
rose,	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
appearance	1
of	1
surprise,	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
expected	1
to	1
be	1
asked	1
to	1
stop.	1
Giving	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
Irene,	1
he	1
allowed	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
conducted	1
to	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
let	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
street.	1
He	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
a	1
cab,	1
he	1
would	1
walk,	1
Irene	1
was	1
to	1
say	1
good-night	1
to	1
Soames	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
if	1
she	1
wanted	1
a	1
little	1
gaiety,	1
well,	1
he	1
would	1
drive	1
her	1
down	1
to	1
Richmond	1
any	1
day.	1
He	1
walked	1
home,	1
and	1
going	1
upstairs,	1
woke	1
Emily	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
sleep	1
she	1
had	2
for	1
four	1
and	1
twenty	1
hours,	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
impression	1
things	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
bad	1
way	1
at	1
Soames’s;	1
on	1
this	1
theme	1
he	1
descanted	1
for	1
half	1
an	1
hour,	1
until	1
at	1
last,	1
saying	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
sleep	1
a	1
wink,	1
he	1
turned	1
on	1
his	1
side	1
and	1
instantly	1
began	1
to	1
snore.	1
In	1
Montpellier	1
Square	1
Soames,	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
picture	1
room,	1
stood	1
invisible	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
stairs,	1
watching	1
Irene	1
sort	1
the	1
letters	1
brought	1
by	1
the	1
last	1
post.	1
She	1
turned	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
drawing-room;	1
but	1
in	1
a	1
minute	1
came	1
out,	1
and	1
stood	1
as	1
if	1
listening.	1
Then	1
she	1
came	1
stealing	1
up	1
the	1
stairs,	1
with	1
a	1
kitten	1
in	1
her	1
arms.	1
He	1
could	1
see	1
her	1
face	1
bent	1
over	1
the	1
little	1
beast,	1
which	1
was	1
purring	1
against	1
her	1
neck.	1
Why	1
couldn’t	1
she	1
look	1
at	1
him	1
like	1
that?	1
Suddenly	1
she	1
saw	1
him,	1
and	1
her	1
face	1
changed.	1
“Any	1
letters	1
for	1
me?”	1
he	1
said.	1
“Three.”	1
He	1
stood	1
aside,	1
and	1
without	1
another	1
word	1
she	1
passed	1
on	1
into	1
the	1
bedroom.	1
Chapter	1
7	1
Old	1
Jolyon’s	1
Peccadillo	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
Lord’s	1
cricket	1
ground	1
that	1
same	1
afternoon	1
with	1
the	1
intention	1
of	1
going	1
home.	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
reached	1
Hamilton	1
Terrace	1
before	1
he	1
changed	1
his	1
mind,	1
and	1
hailing	1
a	1
cab,	1
gave	1
the	1
driver	1
an	1
address	1
in	1
Wistaria	1
Avenue.	1
He	1
had	1
taken	1
a	1
resolution.	1
June	1
had	1
hardly	1
been	1
at	1
home	1
at	1
all	1
that	1
week;	1
she	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
nothing	1
of	1
her	1
company	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
past,	1
not,	1
in	1
fact,	1
since	1
she	1
had	1
become	1
engaged	1
to	1
Bosinney.	1
He	1
never	1
asked	1
her	1
for	1
her	1
company.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
his	1
habit	1
to	1
ask	1
people	1
for	1
things!	1
She	1
had	1
just	1
that	1
one	1
idea	1
now	1
—	1
Bosinney	1
and	1
his	1
affairs	1
—	1
and	1
she	1
left	1
him	1
stranded	1
in	1
his	1
great	1
house,	1
with	1
a	1
parcel	1
of	1
servants,	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
soul	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
from	1
morning	1
to	1
night.	1
His	1
Club	1
was	1
closed	1
for	1
cleaning;	1
his	1
Boards	1
in	1
recess;	1
there	1
was	1
nothing,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
City.	1
June	1
had	1
wanted	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
away;	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
go	1
herself,	1
because	1
Bosinney	1
was	1
in	1
London.	1
But	1
where	1
was	1
he	1
to	1
go	1
by	1
himself?	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
abroad	1
alone;	1
the	1
sea	1
upset	1
his	1
liver;	1
he	1
hated	1
hotels.	1
Roger	1
went	1
to	1
a	1
hydropathic	1
—	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
begin	1
that	1
at	1
his	1
time	1
of	1
life,	1
those	1
new-fangled	1
places	1
we’re	1
all	1
humbug!	1
With	1
such	1
formulas	1
he	1
clothed	1
to	1
himself	1
the	1
desolation	1
of	1
his	1
spirit;	1
the	1
lines	1
down	1
his	1
face	1
deepening,	1
his	1
eyes	1
day	1
by	1
day	1
looking	1
forth	1
with	1
the	1
melancholy	1
which	1
sat	1
so	1
strangely	1
on	1
a	1
face	1
wont	1
to	1
be	1
strong	1
and	1
serene.	1
And	1
so	1
that	1
afternoon	1
he	1
took	1
this	1
journey	1
through	1
St.	1
John’s	1
Wood,	1
in	1
the	1
golden-light	1
that	1
sprinkled	1
the	1
rounded	1
green	1
bushes	1
of	1
the	1
acacia’s	1
before	1
the	1
little	1
houses,	1
in	1
the	1
summer	1
sunshine	1
that	1
seemed	1
holding	1
a	1
revel	1
over	1
the	1
little	1
gardens;	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
about	1
him	1
with	1
interest;	1
for	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
district	1
which	1
no	1
Forsyte	1
entered	1
without	1
open	1
disapproval	1
and	1
secret	1
curiosity.	1
His	1
cab	1
stopped	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
a	1
small	1
house	1
of	1
that	1
peculiar	1
buff	1
colour	1
which	1
implies	1
a	1
long	1
immunity	1
from	1
paint.	1
It	1
had	1
an	1
outer	1
gate,	1
and	1
a	1
rustic	1
approach.	1
He	1
stepped	1
out,	1
his	1
bearing	1
extremely	1
composed;	1
his	1
massive	1
head,	1
with	1
its	1
drooping	1
moustache	1
and	1
wings	1
of	1
white	1
hair,	1
very	1
upright,	1
under	1
an	1
excessively	1
large	1
top	1
hat;	1
his	1
glance	1
firm,	1
a	1
little	1
angry.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
driven	1
into	1
this!	1
“Mrs.	1
Jolyon	1
Forsyte	1
at	1
home?”	1
“Oh,	1
yes	1
sir!	1
—	1
what	1
name	1
shall	1
I	1
say,	1
if	1
you	1
please,	1
sir?”	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
twinkling	1
at	1
the	1
little	1
maid	1
as	1
he	1
gave	1
his	1
name.	1
She	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
such	1
a	1
funny	1
little	1
toad!	1
And	1
he	1
followed	1
her	1
through	1
the	1
dark	1
hall,	1
into	1
a	1
small	1
double,	1
drawing-room,	1
where	1
the	1
furniture	1
was	1
covered	1
in	1
chintz,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
maid	1
placed	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
chair.	1
“They’re	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
garden,	1
sir;	1
if	1
you’ll	1
kindly	1
take	1
a	1
seat,	1
I’ll	1
tell	1
them.”	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
chintz-covered	1
chair,	1
and	1
looked	1
around	1
him.	1
The	1
whole	1
place	1
seemed	1
to	1
him,	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
expressed	1
it,	1
pokey;	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
—	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
tell	1
exactly	1
what	1
—	1
air	1
of	1
shabbiness,	1
or	1
rather	1
of	1
making	1
two	1
ends	1
meet,	1
about	1
everything.	1
As	1
far	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
see,	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
piece	1
of	1
furniture	1
was	1
worth	1
a	1
five-pound	1
note.	1
The	1
walls,	1
distempered	1
rather	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
ago,	1
were	1
decorated	1
with	1
water-colour	1
sketches;	1
across	1
the	1
ceiling	1
meandered	1
a	1
long	1
crack.	1
These	1
little	1
houses	1
were	1
all	1
old,	1
second-rate	1
concerns;	1
he	1
should	1
hope	1
the	1
rent	1
was	1
under	1
a	1
hundred	1
a	1
year;	1
it	1
hurt	1
him	1
more	1
than	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
said,	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
a	1
Forsyte	1
—	1
his	1
own	1
son	1
living	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
place.	1
The	1
little	1
maid	1
came	1
back.	1
Would	1
he	1
please	1
to	1
go	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
garden?	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
marched	1
out	1
through	1
the	1
French	1
windows.	1
In	1
descending	1
the	1
steps	1
he	1
noticed	1
that	1
they	1
wanted	1
painting.	1
Young	1
Jolyon,	1
his	1
wife,	1
his	1
two	1
children,	1
and	1
his	1
dog	1
Balthasar,	1
were	1
all	1
out	1
there	1
under	1
a	1
pear-tree.	1
This	1
walk	1
towards	1
them	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
courageous	1
act	1
of	1
old	1
Jolyon’s	1
life;	1
but	1
no	1
muscle	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
moved,	1
no	1
nervous	1
gesture	1
betrayed	1
him.	1
He	1
kept	1
his	1
deep-set	1
eyes	1
steadily	1
on	1
the	1
enemy.	1
In	1
those	1
two	1
minutes	1
he	1
demonstrated	1
to	1
perfection	1
all	1
that	1
unconscious	1
soundness,	1
balance,	1
and	1
vitality	1
of	1
fibre	1
that	1
made,	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
so	1
many	1
others	1
of	1
his	1
class	1
the	1
core	1
of	1
the	1
nation.	1
In	1
the	1
unostentatious	1
conduct	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
affairs,	1
to	1
the	1
neglect	1
of	1
everything	1
else,	1
they	1
typified	1
the	1
essential	1
individualism,	1
born	1
in	1
the	1
Briton	1
from	1
the	1
natural	1
isolation	1
of	1
his	1
country’s	1
life.	1
The	1
dog	1
Balthasar	1
sniffed	1
round	1
the	1
edges	1
of	1
his	1
trousers;	1
this	1
friendly	1
and	1
cynical	1
mongrel	1
—	1
offspring	1
of	1
a	1
liaison	1
between	1
a	1
Russian	1
poodle	1
and	1
a	1
fox-terrier	1
—	1
had	1
a	1
nose	1
for	1
the	1
unusual.	1
The	1
strange	1
greetings	1
over,	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
seated	1
himself	1
in	1
a	1
wicker	1
chair,	1
and	1
his	1
two	1
grandchildren,	1
one	1
on	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
knees,	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
silently,	1
never	1
having	1
seen	1
so	1
old	1
a	1
man.	1
They	1
were	1
unlike,	1
as	1
though	1
recognising	1
the	1
difference	1
set	1
between	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
circumstances	1
of	1
their	1
births.	1
Jolly,	1
the	1
child	1
of	1
sin,	1
pudgy-faced,	1
with	1
his	1
tow-coloured	1
hair	1
brushed	1
off	1
his	1
forehead,	1
and	1
a	1
dimple	1
in	1
his	1
chin,	1
had	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
stubborn	1
amiability,	1
and	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
a	1
Forsyte;	1
little	1
Holly,	1
the	1
child	1
of	1
wedlock,	1
was	1
a	1
dark-skinned,	1
solemn	1
soul,	1
with	1
her	1
mother’s,	1
grey	1
and	1
wistful	1
eyes.	1
The	1
dog	1
Balthasar,	1
having	1
walked	1
round	1
the	1
three	1
small	1
flower-beds,	1
to	1
show	1
his	1
extreme	1
contempt	1
for	1
things	1
at	1
large,	1
had	1
also	1
taken	1
a	1
seat	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
old	1
Jolyon,	1
and,	1
oscillating	1
a	1
tail	1
curled	1
by	1
Nature	1
tightly	1
over	1
his	1
back,	1
was	1
staring	1
up	1
with	1
eyes	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
blink.	1
Even	1
in	1
the	1
garden,	1
that	1
sense	1
of	1
things	1
being	1
pokey	1
haunted	1
old	1
Jolyon;	1
the	1
wicker	1
chair	1
creaked	1
under	1
his	1
weight;	1
the	1
garden-beds	1
looked	1
‘daverdy’;	1
on	1
the	1
far	1
side,	1
under	1
the	1
smut-stained	1
wall,	1
cats	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
path.	1
While	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
grandchildren	1
thus	1
regarded	1
each	1
other	1
with	1
the	1
peculiar	1
scrutiny,	1
curious	1
yet	1
trustful,	1
that	1
passes	1
between	1
the	1
very	1
young	1
and	1
the	1
very	1
old,	1
young	1
Jolyon	1
watched	1
his	1
wife.	1
The	1
colour	1
had	1
deepened	1
in	1
her	1
thin,	1
oval	1
face,	1
with	1
its	1
straight	1
brows,	1
and	1
large,	1
grey	1
eyes.	1
Her	1
hair,	1
brushed	1
in	1
fine,	1
high	1
curves	1
back	1
from	1
her	1
forehead,	1
was	1
going	1
grey,	1
like	1
his	1
own,	1
and	1
this	1
greyness	1
made	1
the	1
sudden	1
vivid	1
colour	1
in	1
her	1
cheeks	1
painfully	1
pathetic.	1
The	1
look	1
on	1
her	1
face,	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
there	1
before,	1
such	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
always	1
hidden	1
from	1
him,	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
secret	1
resentments,	1
and	1
longings,	1
and	1
fears.	1
Her	1
eyes,	1
under	1
their	1
twitching	1
brows,	1
stared	1
painfully.	1
And	1
she	1
was	1
silent.	1
Jolly	1
alone	1
sustained	1
the	1
conversation;	1
he	1
had	1
many	1
possessions,	1
and	1
was	1
anxious	1
that	1
his	1
unknown	1
friend	1
with	1
extremely	1
large	1
moustaches,	1
and	1
hands	1
all	1
covered	1
with	1
blue	1
veins,	1
who	1
sat	1
with	1
legs	1
crossed	1
like	1
his	1
own	1
father	1
(a	1
habit	1
he	1
was	1
himself	1
trying	1
to	1
acquire),	1
should	1
know	1
it;	1
but	1
being	1
a	1
Forsyte,	1
though	1
not	1
yet	1
quite	1
eight	1
years	1
old,	1
he	1
made	1
no	1
mention	1
of	1
the	1
thing	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
dearest	1
to	1
his	1
heart	1
—	1
a	1
camp	1
of	1
soldiers	1
in	1
a	1
shop-window,	1
which	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
promised	1
to	1
buy.	1
No	1
doubt	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
too	1
precious;	1
a	1
tempting	1
of	1
Providence	1
to	1
mention	1
it	1
yet.	1
And	1
the	1
sunlight	1
played	1
through	1
the	1
leaves	1
on	1
that	1
little	1
party	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
generations	1
grouped	1
tranquilly	1
under	1
the	1
pear-tree,	1
which	1
had	1
long	1
borne	1
no	1
fruit.	1
Old	1
Jolyon’s	1
furrowed	1
face	1
was	1
reddening	1
patchily,	1
as	1
old	1
men’s	1
faces	1
redden	1
in	1
the	1
sun.	1
He	1
took	1
one	1
of	1
Jolly’s	1
hands	1
in	1
his	1
own;	1
the	1
boy	1
climbed	1
on	1
to	1
his	1
knee;	1
and	1
little	1
Holly,	1
mesmerized	1
by	1
this	1
sight,	1
crept	1
up	1
to	1
them;	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
dog	1
Balthasar’s	1
scratching	1
arose	1
rhythmically.	1
Suddenly	1
young	1
Mrs.	1
Jolyon	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
hurried	1
indoors.	1
A	1
minute	1
later	1
her	1
husband	1
muttered	1
an	1
excuse,	1
and	1
followed.	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
was	1
left	1
alone	1
with	1
his	1
grandchildren.	1
And	1
Nature	1
with	1
her	1
quaint	1
irony	1
began	1
working	1
in	1
him	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
strange	1
revolutions,	1
following	1
her	1
cyclic	1
laws	1
into	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
his	1
heart.	1
And	1
that	1
tenderness	1
for	1
little	1
children,	1
that	1
passion	1
for	1
the	1
beginnings	1
of	1
life	1
which	1
had	1
once	1
made	1
him	1
forsake	1
his	1
son	1
and	1
follow	1
June,	1
now	1
worked	1
in	1
him	1
to	1
forsake	1
June	1
and	1
follow	1
these	1
littler	1
things.	1
Youth,	1
like	1
a	1
flame,	1
burned	1
ever	1
in	1
his	1
breast,	1
and	1
to	1
youth	1
he	1
turned,	1
to	1
the	1
round	1
little	1
limbs,	1
so	1
reckless,	1
that	1
wanted	1
care,	1
to	1
the	1
small	1
round	1
faces	1
so	1
unreasonably	1
solemn	1
or	1
bright,	1
to	1
the	1
treble	1
tongues,	1
and	1
the	1
shrill,	1
chuckling	1
laughter,	1
to	1
the	1
insistent	1
tugging	1
hands,	1
and	1
the	1
feel	1
of	1
small	1
bodies	1
against	1
his	1
legs,	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
young	1
and	1
young,	1
and	1
once	1
more	1
young.	1
And	1
his	1
eyes	1
grew	1
soft,	1
his	1
voice,	1
and	1
thin-veined	1
hands	1
soft,	1
and	1
soft	1
his	1
heart	1
within	1
him.	1
And	1
to	1
those	1
small	1
creatures	1
he	1
became	1
at	1
once	1
a	1
place	1
of	1
pleasure,	1
a	1
place	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
secure,	1
and	1
could	1
talk	1
and	1
laugh	1
and	1
play;	1
till,	1
like	1
sunshine,	1
there	1
radiated	1
from	1
old	1
Jolyon’s	1
wicker	1
chair	1
the	1
perfect	1
gaiety	1
of	1
three	1
hearts.	1
But	1
with	1
young	1
Jolyon	1
following	1
to	1
his	1
wife’s	1
room	1
it	1
was	1
different.	1
He	1
found	1
her	1
seated	1
on	1
a	1
chair	1
before	1
her	1
dressing-glass,	1
with	1
her	1
hands	1
before	1
her	1
face.	1
Her	1
shoulders	1
were	1
shaking	1
with	1
sobs.	1
This	1
passion	1
of	1
hers	1
for	1
suffering	1
was	1
mysterious	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
through	1
a	1
hundred	1
of	1
these	1
moods;	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
survived	1
them	1
he	1
never	1
knew,	1
for	1
he	1
could	1
never	1
believe	1
they	1
were	1
moods,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
last	1
hour	1
of	1
his	1
partnership	1
had	1
not	1
struck.	1
In	1
the	1
night	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
throw	1
her	1
arms	1
round	1
his	1
neck	1
and	1
say:	1
“Oh!	1
Jo,	1
how	1
I	1
make	1
you	1
suffer!”	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
done	1
a	1
hundred	1
times	1
before.	1
He	1
reached	1
out	1
his	1
hand,	1
and,	1
unseen,	1
slipped	1
his	1
razor-case	1
into	1
his	1
pocket.	1
‘I	1
cannot	1
stay	1
here,’	1
he	1
thought,	1
‘I	1
must	1
go	1
down!’	1
Without	1
a	1
word	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
lawn.	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
had	1
little	1
Holly	1
on	1
his	1
knee;	1
she	1
had	1
taken	1
possession	1
of	1
his	1
watch;	1
Jolly,	1
very	1
red	1
in	1
the	1
face,	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
stand	1
on	1
his	1
head.	1
The	1
dog	1
Balthasar,	1
as	1
close	1
as	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
to	1
the	1
tea-table,	1
had	1
fixed	1
his	1
eyes	1
on	1
the	1
cake.	1
Young	1
Jolyon	1
felt	1
a	1
malicious	1
desire	1
to	1
cut	1
their	1
enjoyment	1
short.	1
What	1
business	1
had	1
his	1
father	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
upset	1
his	1
wife	1
like	1
this?	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
shock,	1
after	1
all	1
these	1
years!	1
He	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
known;	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
given	1
them	1
warning;	1
but	1
when	1
did	1
a	1
Forsyte	1
ever	1
imagine	1
that	1
his	1
conduct	1
could	1
upset	1
anybody!	1
And	1
in	1
his	1
thoughts	1
he	1
did	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
wrong.	1
He	1
spoke	1
sharply	1
to	1
the	1
children,	1
and	1
told	1
them	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
to	1
their	1
tea.	1
Greatly	1
surprised,	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
never	1
heard	1
their	1
father	1
speak	1
sharply	1
before,	1
they	1
went	1
off,	1
hand	1
in	1
hand,	1
little	1
Holly	1
looking	1
back	1
over	1
her	1
shoulder.	1
Young	1
Jolyon	1
poured	1
out	1
the	1
tea.	1
“My	1
wife’s	1
not	1
the	1
thing	1
today,”	1
he	1
said,	1
but	1
he	1
knew	1
well	1
enough	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
penetrated	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
that	1
sudden	1
withdrawal,	1
and	1
almost	1
hated	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
for	1
sitting	1
there	1
so	1
calmly.	1
“You’ve	1
got	1
a	1
nice	1
little	1
house	1
here,”	1
said	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
with	1
a	1
shrewd	1
look;	1
“I	1
suppose	1
you’ve	1
taken	1
a	1
lease	1
of	1
it!”	1
Young	1
Jolyon	1
nodded.	1
“I	1
don’t	1
like	1
the	1
neighbourhood,”	1
said	1
old	1
Jolyon;	1
“a	1
ramshackle	1
lot.”	1
Young	1
Jolyon	1
replied:	1
“Yes,	1
we’re	1
a	1
ramshackle	1
lot.”’	1
The	1
silence	1
was	1
now	1
only	1
broken	1
by	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
dog	1
Balthasar’s	1
scratching.	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
said	1
simply:	1
“I	1
suppose	1
I	1
oughtn’t	1
to	1
have	1
come	1
here,	1
Jo;	1
but	1
I	1
get	1
so	1
lonely!”	1
At	1
these	1
words	1
young	1
Jolyon	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
on	1
his	1
father’s	1
shoulder.	1
In	1
the	1
next	1
house	1
someone	1
was	1
playing	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
again:	1
‘La	1
Donna	1
mobile’	1
on	1
an	1
untuned	1
piano;	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
garden	1
had	1
fallen	1
into	1
shade,	1
the	1
sun	1
now	1
only	1
reached	1
the	1
wall	1
at	1
the	1
end,	1
whereon	1
basked	1
a	1
crouching	1
cat,	1
her	1
yellow	1
eyes	1
turned	1
sleepily	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
dog	1
Balthasar.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
drowsy	1
hum	1
of	1
very	1
distant	1
traffic;	1
the	1
creepered	1
trellis	1
round	1
the	1
garden	1
shut	1
out	1
everything	1
but	1
sky,	1
and	1
house,	1
and	1
pear-tree,	1
with	1
its	1
top	1
branches	1
still	1
gilded	1
by	1
the	1
sun.	1
For	1
some	1
time	1
they	1
sat	1
there,	1
talking	1
but	1
little.	1
Then	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
rose	1
to	1
go,	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
was	1
said	1
about	1
his	1
coming	1
again.	1
He	1
walked	1
away	1
very	1
sadly.	1
What	1
a	1
poor	1
miserable	1
place;	1
and	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
great,	1
empty	1
house	1
in	1
Stanhope	1
Gate,	1
fit	1
residence	1
for	1
a	1
Forsyte,	1
with	1
its	1
huge	1
billiard-room	1
and	1
drawing-room	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
entered	1
from	1
one	1
week’s	1
end	1
to	1
another.	1
That	1
woman,	1
whose	1
face	1
he	1
had	1
rather	1
liked,	1
was	1
too	1
thin-skinned	1
by	1
half;	1
she	1
gave	1
Jo	1
a	1
bad	1
time	1
he	1
knew!	1
And	1
those	1
sweet	1
children!	1
Ah!	1
what	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
awful	1
folly!	1
He	1
walked	1
towards	1
the	1
Edgware	1
Road,	1
between	1
rows	1
of	1
little	1
houses,	1
all	1
suggesting	1
to	1
him	1
(erroneously	1
no	1
doubt,	1
but	1
the	1
prejudices	1
of	1
a	1
Forsyte	1
are	1
sacred)	1
shady	1
histories	1
of	1
some	1
sort	1
or	1
kind.	1
Society,	1
forsooth,	1
the	1
chattering	1
hags	1
and	1
jackanapes	1
—	1
had	1
set	1
themselves	1
up	1
to	1
pass	1
judgment	1
on	1
his	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood!	1
A	1
parcel	1
of	1
old	1
women!	1
He	1
stumped	1
his	1
umbrella	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
as	1
though	1
to	1
drive	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
that	1
unfortunate	1
body,	1
which	1
had	1
dared	1
to	1
ostracize	1
his	1
son	1
and	1
his	1
son’s	1
son,	1
in	1
whom	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
lived	1
again!	1
He	1
stumped	1
his	1
umbrella	1
fiercely;	1
yet	1
he	1
himself	1
had	1
followed	1
Society’s	1
behaviour	1
for	1
fifteen	1
years	1
—	1
had	1
only	1
today	1
been	1
false	1
to	1
it!	1
He	1
thought	1
of	1
June,	1
and	1
her	1
dead	1
mother,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
story,	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
old	1
bitterness.	1
A	1
wretched	1
business!	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
reaching	1
Stanhope	1
Gate,	1
for,	1
with	1
native	1
perversity,	1
being	1
extremely	1
tired,	1
he	1
walked	1
the	1
whole	1
way.	1
After	1
washing	1
his	1
hands	1
in	1
the	1
lavatory	1
downstairs,	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
dining-room	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
dinner,	1
the	1
only	1
room	1
he	1
used	1
when	1
June	1
was	1
out	1
—	1
it	1
was	1
less	1
lonely	1
so.	1
The	1
evening	1
paper	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
come;	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
the	1
Times,	1
there	1
was	1
therefore	1
nothing	1
to	1
do.	1
The	1
room	1
faced	1
the	1
backwater	1
of	1
traffic,	1
and	1
was	1
very	1
silent.	1
He	1
disliked	1
dogs,	1
but	1
a	1
dog	1
even	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
company.	1
His	1
gaze,	1
travelling	1
round	1
the	1
walls,	1
rested	1
on	1
a	1
picture	1
entitled:	1
‘Group	1
of	1
Dutch	1
fishing	1
boats	1
at	1
sunset’;	1
the	1
chef	1
d’oeuvre	1
of	1
his	1
collection.	1
It	1
gave	1
him	1
no	1
pleasure.	1
He	1
closed	1
his	1
eyes.	1
He	1
was	1
lonely!	1
He	1
oughtn’t	1
to	1
complain,	1
he	1
knew,	1
but	1
he	1
couldn’t	1
help	1
it:	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
poor	1
thing	1
—	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
a	1
poor	1
thing	1
—	1
no	1
pluck!	1
Such	1
was	1
his	1
thought.	1
The	1
butler	1
came	1
to	1
lay	1
the	1
table	1
for	1
dinner,	1
and	1
seeing	1
his	1
master	1
apparently	1
asleep,	1
exercised	1
extreme	1
caution	1
in	1
his	1
movements.	1
This	1
bearded	1
man	1
also	1
wore	1
a	1
moustache,	1
which	1
had	1
given	1
rise	1
to	1
grave	1
doubts	1
in	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
many	1
members	1
—	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
—	1
especially	1
those	1
who,	1
like	1
Soames,	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
public	1
schools,	1
and	1
were	1
accustomed	1
to	1
niceness	1
in	1
such	1
matters.	1
Could	1
he	1
really	1
be	1
considered	1
a	1
butler?	1
Playful	1
spirits	1
alluded	1
to	1
him	1
as:	1
‘Uncle	1
Jolyon’s	1
Nonconformist’;	1
George,	1
the	1
acknowledged	1
wag,	1
had	1
named	1
him:	1
‘Sankey.’	1
He	1
moved	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
between	1
the	1
great	1
polished	1
sideboard	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
polished	1
table	1
inimitably	1
sleek	1
and	1
soft.	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
watched	1
him,	1
feigning	1
sleep.	1
The	1
fellow	1
was	1
a	1
sneak	1
—	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
thought	1
so	1
—	1
who	1
cared	1
about	1
nothing	1
but	1
rattling	1
through	1
his	1
work,	1
and	1
getting	1
out	1
to	1
his	1
betting	1
or	1
his	1
woman	1
or	1
goodness	1
knew	1
what!	1
A	1
slug!	1
Fat	1
too!	1
And	1
didn’t	1
care	1
a	1
pin	1
about	1
his	1
master!	1
But	1
then	1
against	1
his	1
will,	1
came	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
moments	1
of	1
philosophy	1
which	1
made	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
different	1
from	1
other	1
Forsytes:	1
After	1
all	1
why	1
should	1
the	1
man	1
care?	1
He	1
wasn’t	1
paid	1
to	1
care,	1
and	1
why	1
expect	1
it?	1
In	1
this	1
world	1
people	1
couldn’t	1
look	1
for	1
affection	1
unless	1
they	1
paid	1
for	1
it.	1
It	1
might	1
be	1
different	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
—	1
he	1
didn’t	1
know	1
—	1
couldn’t	1
tell!	1
And	1
again	1
he	1
shut	1
his	1
eyes.	1
Relentless	1
and	1
stealthy,	1
the	1
butler	1
pursued	1
his	1
labours,	1
taking	1
things	1
from	1
the	1
various	1
compartments	1
of	1
the	1
sideboard.	1
His	1
back	1
seemed	1
always	1
turned	1
to	1
old	1
Jolyon;	1
thus,	1
he	1
robbed	1
his	1
operations	1
of	1
the	1
unseemliness	1
of	1
being	1
carried	1
on	1
in	1
his	1
master’s	1
presence;	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
furtively	1
breathed	1
on	1
the	1
silver,	1
and	1
wiped	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
chamois	1
leather.	1
He	1
appeared	1
to	1
pore	1
over	1
the	1
quantities	1
of	1
wine	1
in	1
the	1
decanters,	1
which	1
he	1
carried	1
carefully	1
and	1
rather	1
high,	1
letting	1
his	1
heard	1
droop	1
over	1
them	1
protectingly.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
finished,	1
he	1
stood	1
for	1
over	1
a	1
minute	1
watching	1
his	1
master,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
greenish	1
eyes	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
contempt:	1
After	1
all,	1
this	1
master	1
of	1
his	1
was	1
an	1
old	1
buffer,	1
who	1
hadn’t	1
much	1
left	1
in	1
him!	1
Soft	1
as	1
a	1
tom-cat,	1
he	1
crossed	1
the	1
room	1
to	1
press	1
the	1
bell.	1
His	1
orders	1
were	1
‘dinner	1
at	1
seven.’	1
What	1
if	1
his	1
master	1
were	1
asleep;	1
he	1
would	1
soon	1
have	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
that;	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
night	1
to	1
sleep	1
in!	1
He	1
had	1
himself	1
to	1
think	1
of,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
due	1
at	1
his	1
Club	1
at	1
half-past	1
eight!	1
In	1
answer	1
to	1
the	1
ring,	1
appeared	1
a	1
page	1
boy	1
with	1
a	1
silver	1
soup	1
tureen.	1
The	1
butler	1
took	1
it	1
from	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
placed	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
table,	1
then,	1
standing	1
by	1
the	1
open	1
door,	1
as	1
though	1
about	1
to	1
usher	1
company	1
into	1
the	1
room,	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
solemn	1
voice:	1
“Dinner	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
table,	1
sir!”	1
Slowly	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
got	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
chair,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
to	1
eat	1
his	1
dinner.	1

appeared	1
to	1
have	1
no	1
habitat,	1
he	1
seemed	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
rare	1
and	1
unfortunate	1
men	1
who	1
go	1
through	1
life	1
surrounded	1
by	1
circumstance,	1
property,	1
acquaintances,	1
and	1
wives	1
that	1
do	1
not	1
belong	1
to	1
them.	1
His	1
rooms	1
in	1
Sloane	1
Street,	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
floor,	1
outside	1
which,	1
on	1
a	1
plate,	1
was	1
his	1
name,	1
‘Philip	1
Baynes	1
Bosinney,	1
Architect,’	1
were	1
not	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
Forsyte.	1
—	1
He	1
had	1
no	1
sitting-room	1
apart	1
from	1
his	1
office,	1
but	1
a	1
large	1
recess	1
had	1
been	1
screened	1
off	1
to	1
conceal	1
the	1
necessaries	1
of	1
life	1
—	1
a	1
couch,	1
an	1
easy	1
chair,	1
his	1
pipes,	1
spirit	1
case,	1
novels	1
and	1
slippers.	1
The	1
business	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
had	1
the	1
usual	1
furniture;	1
an	1
open	1
cupboard	1
with	1
pigeon-holes,	1
a	1
round	1
oak	1
table,	1
a	1
folding	1
wash-stand,	1
some	1
hard	1
chairs,	1
a	1
standing	1
desk	1
of	1
large	1
dimensions	1
covered	1
with	1
drawings	1
and	1
designs.	1
June	1
had	1
twice	1
been	1
to	1
tea	1
there	1
under	1
the	1
chaperonage	1
of	1
his	1
aunt.	1
He	1
was	1
believed	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
bedroom	1
at	1
the	1
back.	1
As	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
family	1
had	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
ascertain	1
his	1
income,	1
it	1
consisted	1
of	1
two	1
consulting	1
appointments	1
at	1
twenty	1
pounds	1
a	1
year,	1
together	1
with	1
an	1
odd	1
fee	1
once	1
in	1
a	1
way,	1
and	1
—	1
more	1
worthy	1
item	1
—	1
a	1
private	1
annuity	1
under	1
his	1
father’s	1
will	1
of	1
one	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
pounds	1
a	1
year.	1
What	1
had	1
transpired	1
concerning	1
that	1
father	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
reassuring.	1
It	1
appeared	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
Lincolnshire	1
country	1
doctor	1
of	1
Cornish	1
extraction,	1
striking	1
appearance,	1
and	1
Byronic	1
tendencies	1
—	1
a	1
well-known	1
figure,	1
in	1
fact,	1
in	1
his	1
county.	1
Bosinney’s	1
uncle	1
by	1
marriage,	1
Baynes,	1
of	1
Baynes	1
and	1
Bildeboy,	1
a	1
Forsyte	1
in	1
instincts	1
if	1
not	1
in	1
name,	1
had	1
but	1
little	1
that	1
was	1
worthy	1
to	1
relate	1
of	1
his	1
brother-in-law.	1
“An	1
odd	1
fellow!’	1
he	1
would	1
say:	1
‘always	1
spoke	1
of	1
his	1
three	1
eldest	1
boys	1
as	1
‘good	1
creatures,	1
but	1
so	1
dull’;	1
they’re	1
all	1
doing	1
capitally	1
in	1
the	1
Indian	1
Civil!	1
Philip	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
he	1
liked.	1
I’ve	1
heard	1
him	1
talk	1
in	1
the	1
queerest	1
way;	1
he	1
once	1
said	1
to	1
me:	1
‘My	1
dear	1
fellow,	1
never	1
let	1
your	1
poor	1
wife	1
know	1
what	1
you’re	1
thinking	1
of!	1
But	1
I	1
didn’t	1
follow	1
his	1
advice;	1
not	1
I!	1
An	1
eccentric	1
man!	1
He	1
would	1
say	1
to	1
Phil:	1
‘Whether	1
you	1
live	1
like	1
a	1
gentleman	1
or	1
not,	1
my	1
boy,	1
be	1
sure	1
you	1
die	1
like	1
one!	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
himself	1
embalmed	1
in	1
a	1
frock	1
coat	1
suit,	1
with	1
a	1
satin	1
cravat	1
and	1
a	1
diamond	1
pin.	1
Oh,	1
quite	1
an	1
original,	1
I	1
can	1
assure	1
you!”	1
Of	1
Bosinney	1
himself	1
Baynes	1
would	1
speak	1
warmly,	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
compassion:	1
“He’s	1
got	1
a	1
streak	1
of	1
his	1
father’s	1
Byronism.	1
Why,	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
threw	1
up	1
his	1
chances	1
when	1
he	1
left	1
my	1
office;	1
going	1
off	1
like	1
that	1
for	1
six	1
months	1
with	1
a	1
knapsack,	1
and	1
all	1
for	1
what?	1
—	1
to	1
study	1
foreign	1
architecture	1
—	1
foreign!	1
What	1
could	1
he	1
expect?	1
And	1
there	1
he	1
is	1
—	1
a	1
clever	1
young	1
fellow	1
—	1
doesn’t	1
make	1
his	1
hundred	1
a	1
year!	1
Now	1
this	1
engagement	1
is	1
the	1
best	1
thing	1
that	1
could	1
have	1
happened	1
—	1
keep	1
him	1
steady;	1
he’s	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
go	1
to	1
bed	1
all	1
day	1
and	1
stay	1
up	1
all	1
night,	1
simply	1
because	1
they’ve	1
no	1
method;	1
but	1
no	1
vice	1
about	1
him	1
—	1
not	1
an	1
ounce	1
of	1
vice.	1
Old	1
Forsyte’s	1
a	1
rich	1
man!”	1
Mr.	1
Baynes	1
made	1
himself	1
extremely	1
pleasant	1
to	1
June,	1
who	1
frequently	1
visited	1
his	1
house	1
in	1
Lowndes	1
Square	1
at	1
this	1
period.	1
“This	1
house	1
of	1
your	1
cousin’s	1
—	1
what	1
a	1
capital	1
man	1
of	1
business	1
—	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
thing	1
for	1
Philip,”	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
to	1
her;	1
“you	1
mustn’t	1
expect	1
to	1
see	1
too	1
much	1
of	1
him	1
just	1
now,	1
my	1
dear	1
young	1
lady.	1
The	1
good	1
cause	1
—	1
the	1
good	1
cause!	1
The	1
young	1
man	1
must	1
make	1
his	1
way.	1
When	1
I	1
was	1
his	1
age	1
I	1
was	1
at	1
work	1
day	1
and	1
night.	1
My	1
dear	1
wife	1
used	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
me,	1
‘Bobby,	1
don’t	1
work	1
too	1
hard,	1
think	1
of	1
your	1
health’;	1
but	1
I	1
never	1
spared	1
myself!”	1
June	1
had	1
complained	1
that	1
her	1
lover	1
found	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
Stanhope	1
Gate.	1
The	1
first	1
time	1
he	1
came	1
again	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
together	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
before,	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
coincidences	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
mistress,	1
Mrs.	1
Septimus	1
Small	1
arrived.	1
Thereon	1
Bosinney	1
rose	1
and	1
hid	1
himself,	1
according	1
to	1
previous	1
arrangement,	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
study,	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
her	1
departure.	1
“My	1
dear,”	1
said	1
Aunt	1
Juley,	1
“how	1
thin	1
he	1
is!	1
I’ve	1
often	1
noticed	1
it	1
with	1
engaged	1
people;	1
but	1
you	1
mustn’t	1
let	1
it	1
get	1
worse.	1
There’s	1
Barlow’s	1
extract	1
of	1
veal;	1
it	1
did	1
your	1
Uncle	1
Swithin	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
good.”	1
June,	1
her	1
little	1
figure	1
erect	1
before	1
the	1
hearth,	1
her	1
small	1
face	1
quivering	1
grimly,	1
for	1
she	1
regarded	1
her	1
aunt’s	1
untimely	1
visit	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
a	1
personal	1
injury,	1
replied	1
with	1
scorn:	1
“It’s	1
because	1
he’s	1
busy;	1
people	1
who	1
can	1
do	1
anything	1
worth	1
doing	1
are	1
never	1
fat!”	1
Aunt	1
Juley	1
pouted;	1
she	1
herself	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
thin,	1
but	1
the	1
only	1
pleasure	1
she	1
derived	1
from	1
the	1
fact	1
was	1
the	1
opportunity	1
of	1
longing	1
to	1
be	1
stouter.	1
“I	1
don’t	1
think,”	1
she	1
said	1
mournfully,	1
“that	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
let	1
them	1
call	1
him	1
‘The	1
Buccaneer’;	1
people	1
might	1
think	1
it	1
odd,	1
now	1
that	1
he’s	1
going	1
to	1
build	1
a	1
house	1
for	1
Soames.	1
I	1
do	1
hope	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
careful;	1
it’s	1
so	1
important	1
for	1
him.	1
Soames	1
has	1
such	1
good	1
taste!”	1
“Taste!”	1
cried	1
June,	1
flaring	1
up	1
at	1
once;	1
“wouldn’t	1
give	1
that	1
for	1
his	1
taste,	1
or	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
family’s!”	1
Mrs.	1
Small	1
was	1
taken	1
aback.	1
“Your	1
Uncle	1
Swithin,”	1
she	1
said,	1
“always	1
had	1
beautiful	1
taste!	1
And	1
Soames’s	1
little	1
house	1
is	1
lovely;	1
you	1
don’t	1
mean	1
to	1
say	1
you	1
don’t	1
think	1
so!”	1
“H’mph!”	1
said	1
June,	1
“that’s	1
only	1
because	1
Irene’s	1
there!”	1
Aunt	1
Juley	1
tried	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
pleasant:	1
“And	1
how	1
will	1
dear	1
Irene	1
like	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
country?”	1
June	1
gazed	1
at	1
her	1
intently,	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
as	1
if	1
her	1
conscience	1
had	1
suddenly	1
leaped	1
up	1
into	1
them;	1
it	1
passed;	1
and	1
an	1
even	1
more	1
intent	1
look	1
took	1
its	1
place,	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
stared	1
that	1
conscience	1
out	1
of	1
countenance.	1
She	1
replied	1
imperiously:	1
“Of	1
course	1
she’ll	1
like	1
it;	1
why	1
shouldn’t	1
she?”	1
Mrs.	1
Small	1
grew	1
nervous.	1
“I	1
didn’t	1
know,”	1
she	1
said;	1
“I	1
thought	1
she	1
mightn’t	1
like	1
to	1
leave	1
her	1
friends.	1
Your	1
Uncle	1
James	1
says	1
she	1
doesn’t	1
take	1
enough	1
interest	1
in	1
life.	1
We	1
think	1
—	1
I	1
mean	1
Timothy	1
thinks	1
—	1
she	1
ought	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
more.	1
I	1
expect	1
you’ll	1
miss	1
her	1
very	1
much!”	1
June	1
clasped	1
her	1
hands	1
behind	1
her	1
neck.	1
“I	1
do	1
wish,”	1
she	1
cried,	1
“Uncle	1
Timothy	1
wouldn’t	1
talk	1
about	1
what	1
doesn’t	1
concern	1
him!”	1
Aunt	1
Juley	1
rose	1
to	1
the	1
full	1
height	1
of	1
her	1
tall	1
figure.	1
“He	1
never	1
talks	1
about	1
what	1
doesn’t	1
concern	1
him,”	1
she	1
said.	1
June	1
was	1
instantly	1
compunctious;	1
she	1
ran	1
to	1
her	1
aunt	1
and	1
kissed	1
her.	1
“I’m	1
very	1
sorry,	1
auntie;	1
but	1
I	1
wish	1
they’d	1
let	1
Irene	1
alone.”	1
Aunt	1
Juley,	1
unable	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
anything	1
further	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
suitable,	1
was	1
silent;	1
she	1
prepared	1
for	1
departure,	1
hooking	1
her	1
black	1
silk	1
cape	1
across	1
her	1
chest,	1
and,	1
taking	1
up	1
her	1
green	1
reticule:	1
“And	1
how	1
is	1
your	1
dear	1
grandfather?”	1
she	1
asked	1
in	1
the	1
hall,	1
“I	1
expect	1
he’s	1
very	1
lonely	1
now	1
that	1
all	1
your	1
time	1
is	1
taken	1
up	1
with	1
Mr.	1
Bosinney.”	1
She	1
bent	1
and	1
kissed	1
her	1
niece	1
hungrily,	1
and	1
with	1
little,	1
mincing	1
steps	1
passed	1
away.	1
The	1
tears	1
sprang	1
up	1
in	1
June’s	1
eyes;	1
running	1
into	1
the	1
little	1
study,	1
where	1
Bosinney	1
was	1
sitting	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
drawing	1
birds	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
an	1
envelope,	1
she	1
sank	1
down	1
by	1
his	1
side	1
and	1
cried:	1
“Oh,	1
Phil!	1
it’s	1
all	1
so	1
horrid!”	1
Her	1
heart	1
was	1
as	1
warm	1
as	1
the	1
colour	1
of	1
her	1
hair.	1
On	1
the	1
following	1
Sunday	1
morning,	1
while	1
Soames	1
was	1
shaving,	1
a	1
message	1
was	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
effect	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Bosinney	1
was	1
below,	1
and	1
would	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
him.	1
Opening	1
the	1
door	1
into	1
his	1
wife’s	1
room,	1
he	1
said:	1
“Bosinney’s	1
downstairs.	1
Just	1
go	1
and	1
entertain	1
him	1
while	1
I	1
finish	1
shaving.	1
I’ll	1
be	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
minute.	1
It’s	1
about	1
the	1
plans,	1
I	1
expect.”	1
Irene	1
looked	1
at	1
him,	1
without	1
reply,	1
put	1
the	1
finishing	1
touch	1
to	1
her	1
dress	1
and	1
went	1
downstairs.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
her	1
out	1
about	1
this	1
house.	1
She	1
had	1
said	1
nothing	1
against	1
it,	1
and,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
Bosinney	1
was	1
concerned,	1
seemed	1
friendly	1
enough.	1
From	1
the	1
window	1
of	1
his	1
dressing-room	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
them	1
talking	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
court	1
below.	1
He	1
hurried	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
shaving,	1
cutting	1
his	1
chin	1
twice.	1
He	1
heard	1
them	1
laugh,	1
and	1
thought	1
to	1
himself:	1
“Well,	1
they	1
get	1
on	1
all	1
right,	1
anyway!”	1
As	1
he	1
expected,	1
Bosinney	1
had	1
come	1
round	1
to	1
fetch	1
him	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
plans.	1
He	1
took	1
his	1
hat	1
and	1
went	1
over.	1
The	1
plans	1
were	1
spread	1
on	1
the	1
oak	1
table	1
in	1
the	1
architect’s	1
room;	1
and	1
pale,	1
imperturbable,	1
inquiring,	1
Soames	1
bent	1
over	1
them	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
without	1
speaking.	1
He	1
said	1
at	1
last	1
in	1
a	1
puzzled	1
voice:	1
“It’s	1
an	1
odd	1
sort	1
of	1
house!”	1
A	1
rectangular	1
house	1
of	1
two	1
stories	1
was	1
designed	1
in	1
a	1
quadrangle	1
round	1
a	1
covered-in	1
court.	1
This	1
court,	1
encircled	1
by	1
a	1
gallery	1
on	1
the	1
upper	1
floor,	1
was	1
roofed	1
with	1
a	1
glass	1
roof,	1
supported	1
by	1
eight	1
columns	1
running	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
ground.	1
It	1
was	1
indeed,	1
to	1
Forsyte	1
eyes,	1
an	1
odd	1
house.	1
“There’s	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
room	1
cut	1
to	1
waste,”	1
pursued	1
Soames.	1
Bosinney	1
began	1
to	1
walk	1
about,	1
and	1
Soames	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
the	1
expression	1
on	1
his	1
face.	1
“The	1
principle	1
of	1
this	1
house,”	1
said	1
the	1
architect,	1
“was	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
have	1
room	1
to	1
breathe	1
—	1
like	1
a	1
gentleman!”	1
Soames	1
extended	1
his	1
finger	1
and	1
thumb,	1
as	1
if	1
measuring	1
the	1
extent	1
of	1
the	1
distinction	1
he	1
should	1
acquire;	1
and	1
replied:	1
“Oh!	1
yes;	1
I	1
see.”	1
The	1
peculiar	1
look	1
came	1
into	1
Bosinney’s	1
face	1
which	1
marked	1
all	1
his	1
enthusiasms.	1
“I’ve	1
tried	1
to	1
plan	1
you	1
a	1
house	1
here	1
with	1
some	1
self-respect	1
of	1
its	1
own.	1
If	1
you	1
don’t	1
like	1
it,	1
you’d	1
better	1
say	1
so.	1
It’s	1
certainly	1
the	1
last	1
thing	1
to	1
be	1
considered	1
—	1
who	1
wants	1
self-respect	1
in	1
a	1
house,	1
when	1
you	1
can	1
squeeze	1
in	1
an	1
extra	1
lavatory?”	1
He	1
put	1
his	1
finger	1
suddenly	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
division	1
of	1
the	1
centre	1
oblong:	1
“You	1
can	1
swing	1
a	1
cat	1
here.	1
This	1
is	1
for	1
your	1
pictures,	1
divided	1
from	1
this	1
court	1
by	1
curtains;	1
draw	1
them	1
back	1
and	1
you’ll	1
have	1
a	1
space	1
of	1
fifty-one	1
by	1
twenty-three	1
six.	1
This	1
double-faced	1
stove	1
in	1
the	1
centre,	1
here,	1
looks	1
one	1
way	1
towards	1
the	1
court,	1
one	1
way	1
towards	1
the	1
picture	1
room;	1
this	1
end	1
wall	1
is	1
all	1
window;	1
You’ve	1
a	1
southeast	1
light	1
from	1
that,	1
a	1
north	1
light	1
from	1
the	1
court.	1
The	1
rest	1
of	1
your	1
pictures	1
you	1
can	1
hang	1
round	1
the	1
gallery	1
upstairs,	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
rooms.”	1
“In	1
architecture,”	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
—	1
and	1
though	1
looking	1
at	1
Soames	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
see	1
him,	1
which	1
gave	1
Soames	1
an	1
unpleasant	1
feeling	1
—“as	1
in	1
life,	1
you’ll	1
get	1
no	1
self-respect	1
without	1
regularity.	1
Fellows	1
tell	1
you	1
that’s	1
old	1
fashioned.	1
It	1
appears	1
to	1
be	1
peculiar	1
any	1
way;	1
it	1
never	1
occurs	1
to	1
us	1
to	1
embody	1
the	1
main	1
principle	1
of	1
life	1
in	1
our	1
buildings;	1
we	1
load	1
our	1
houses	1
with	1
decoration,	1
gimcracks,	1
corners,	1
anything	1
to	1
distract	1
the	1
eye.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary	1
the	1
eye	1
should	1
rest;	1
get	1
your	1
effects	1
with	1
a	1
few	1
strong	1
lines.	1
The	1
whole	1
thing	1
is	1
regularity	1
there’s	1
no	1
self-respect	1
without	1
it.”	1
Soames,	1
the	1
unconscious	1
ironist,	1
fixed	1
his	1
gaze	1
on	1
Bosinney’s	1
tie,	1
which	1
was	1
far	1
from	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
perpendicular;	1
he	1
was	1
unshaven	1
too,	1
and	1
his	1
dress	1
not	1
remarkable	1
for	1
order.	1
Architecture	1
appeared	1
to	1
have	1
exhausted	1
his	1
regularity.	1
“Won’t	1
it	1
look	1
like	1
a	1
barrack?”	1
he	1
inquired.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
at	1
once	1
receive	1
a	1
reply.	1
“I	1
can	1
see	1
what	1
it	1
is,”	1
said	1
Bosinney,	1
“you	1
want	1
one	1
of	1
Littlemaster’s	1
houses	1
—	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
pretty	1
and	1
commodious	1
sort,	1
where	1
the	1
servants	1
will	1
live	1
in	1
garrets,	1
and	1
the	1
front	1
door	1
be	1
sunk	1
so	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
come	1
up	1
again.	1
By	1
all	1
means	1
try	1
Littlemaster,	1
you’ll	1
find	1
him	1
a	1
capital	1
fellow,	1
I’ve	1
known	1
him	1
all	1
my	1
life!”	1
Soames	1
was	1
alarmed.	1
He	1
had	1
really	1
been	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
plans,	1
and	1
the	1
concealment	1
of	1
his	1
satisfaction	1
had	1
been	1
merely	1
instinctive.	1
It	1
was	1
difficult	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
pay	1
a	1
compliment.	1
He	1
despised	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
lavish	1
with	1
their	1
praises.	1
He	1
found	1
himself	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
embarrassing	1
position	1
of	1
one	1
who	1
must	1
pay	1
a	1
compliment	1
or	1
run	1
the	1
risk	1
of	1
losing	1
a	1
good	1
thing.	1
Bosinney	1
was	1
just	1
the	1
fellow	1
who	1
might	1
tear	1
up	1
the	1
plans	1
and	1
refuse	1
to	1
act	1
for	1
him;	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
grown-up	1
child!	1
This	1
grown-up	1
childishness,	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
felt	1
so	1
superior,	1
exercised	1
a	1
peculiar	1
and	1
almost	1
mesmeric	1
effect	1
on	1
Soames,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
felt	1
anything	1
like	1
it	1
in	1
himself.	1
“Well,”	1
he	1
stammered	1
at	1
last,	1
“it’s	1
—	1
it’s,	1
certainly	1
original.”	1
He	1
had	1
such	1
a	1
private	1
distrust	1
and	1
even	1
dislike	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
‘original’	1
that	1
he	1
felt	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
really	1
given	1
himself	1
away	1
by	1
this	1
remark.	1
Bosinney	1
seemed	1
pleased.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
thing	1
that	1
would	1
please	1
a	1
fellow	1
like	1
that!	1
And	1
his	1
success	1
encouraged	1
Soames.	1
“It’s	1
—	1
a	1
big	1
place,”	1
he	1
said.	1
“Space,	1
air,	1
light,”	1
he	1
heard	1
Bosinney	1
murmur,	1
“you	1
can’t	1
live	1
like	1
a	1
gentleman	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
Littlemaster’s	1
—	1
he	1
builds	1
for	1
manufacturers.”	1
Soames	1
made	1
a	1
deprecating	1
movement;	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
identified	1
with	1
a	1
gentleman;	1
not	1
for	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
of	1
money	1
now	1
would	1
he	1
be	1
classed	1
with	1
manufacturers.	1
But	1
his	1
innate	1
distrust	1
of	1
general	1
principles	1
revived.	1
What	1
the	1
deuce	1
was	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
talking	1
about	1
regularity	1
and	1
self-respect?	1
It	1
looked	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
house	1
would	1
be	1
cold.	1
“Irene	1
can’t	1
stand	1
the	1
cold!”	1
he	1
said.	1
“Ah!”	1
said	1
Bosinney	1
sarcastically.	1
“Your	1
wife?	1
She	1
doesn’t	1
like	1
the	1
cold?	1
I’ll	1
see	1
to	1
that;	1
she	1
shan’t	1
be	1
cold.	1
Look	1
here!”	1
he	1
pointed,	1
to	1
four	1
marks	1
at	1
regular	1
intervals	1
on	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
court.	1
“I’ve	1
given	1
you	1
hot-water	1
pipes	1
in	1
aluminium	1
casings;	1
you	1
can	1
get	1
them	1
with	1
very	1
good	1
designs.”	1
Soames	1
looked	1
suspiciously	1
at	1
these	1
marks.	1
“It’s	1
all	1
very	1
well,	1
all	1
this,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“but	1
what’s	1
it	1
going	1
to	1
cost?”	1
The	1
architect	1
took	1
a	1
sheet	1
of	1
paper	1
from	1
his	1
pocket:	1
“The	1
house,	1
of	1
course,	1
should	1
be	1
built	1
entirely	1
of	1
stone,	1
but,	1
as	1
I	1
thought	1
you	1
wouldn’t	1
stand	1
that,	1
I’ve	1
compromised	1
for	1
a	1
facing.	1
It	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
copper	1
roof,	1
but	1
I’ve	1
made	1
it	1
green	1
slate.	1
As	1
it	1
is,	1
including	1
metal	1
work,	1
it’ll	1
cost	1
you	1
eight	1
thousand	1
five	1
hundred.”	1
“Eight	1
thousand	1
five	1
hundred?”	1
said	1
Soames.	1
“Why,	1
I	1
gave	1
you	1
an	1
outside	1
limit	1
of	1
eight!”	1
“Can’t	1
be	1
done	1
for	1
a	1
penny	1
less,”	1
replied	1
Bosinney	1
coolly.	1
“You	1
must	1
take	1
it	1
or	1
leave	1
it!”	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
way,	1
probably,	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
proposition	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
to	1
Soames.	1
He	1
was	1
nonplussed.	1
Conscience	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
throw	1
the	1
whole	1
thing	1
up.	1
But	1
the	1
design	1
was	1
good,	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
it	1
—	1
there	1
was	1
completeness	1
about	1
it,	1
and	1
dignity;	1
the	1
servants’	1
apartments	1
were	1
excellent	1
too.	1
He	1
would	1
gain	1
credit	1
by	1
living	1
in	1
a	1
house	1
like	1
that	1
—	1
with	1
such	1
individual	1
features,	1
yet	1
perfectly	1
well-arranged.	1
He	1
continued	1
poring	1
over	1
the	1
plans,	1
while	1
Bosinney	1
went	1
into	1
his	1
bedroom	1
to	1
shave	1
and	1
dress.	1
The	1
two	1
walked	1
back	1
to	1
Montpellier	1
Square	1
in	1
silence,	1
Soames	1
watching	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
his	1
eye.	1
The	1
Buccaneer	1
was	1
rather	1
a	1
good-looking	1
fellow	1
—	1
so	1
he	1
thought	1
—	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
properly	1
got	1
up.	1
Irene	1
was	1
bending	1
over	1
her	1
flowers	1
when	1
the	1
two	1
men	1
came	1
in.	1
She	1
spoke	1
of	1
sending	1
across	1
the	1
Park	1
to	1
fetch	1
June.	1
“No,	1
no,”	1
said	1
Soames,	1
“we’ve	1
still	1
got	1
business	1
to	1
talk	1
over!”	1
At	1
lunch	1
he	1
was	1
almost	1
cordial,	1
and	1
kept	1
pressing	1
Bosinney	1
to	1
eat.	1
He	1
was	1
pleased	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
architect	1
in	1
such	1
high	1
spirits,	1
and	1
left	1
him	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
afternoon	1
with	1
Irene,	1
while	1
he	1
stole	1
off	1
to	1
his	1
pictures,	1
after	1
his	1
Sunday	1
habit.	1
At	1
tea-time	1
he	1
came	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
drawing-room,	1
and	1
found	1
them	1
talking,	1
as	1
he	1
expressed	1
it,	1
nineteen	1
to	1
the	1
dozen.	1
Unobserved	1
in	1
the	1
doorway,	1
he	1
congratulated	1
himself	1
that	1
things	1
were	1
taking	1
the	1
right	1
turn.	1
It	1
was	1
lucky	1
she	1
and	1
Bosinney	1
got	1
on;	1
she	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
falling	1
into	1
line	1
with	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
house.	1
Quiet	1
meditation	1
among	1
his	1
pictures	1
had	1
decided	1
him	1
to	1
spring	1
the	1
five	1
hundred	1
if	1
necessary;	1
but	1
he	1
hoped	1
that	1
the	1
afternoon	1
might	1
have	1
softened	1
Bosinney’s	1
estimates.	1
It	1
was	1
so	1
purely	1
a	1
matter	1
which	1
Bosinney	1
could	1
remedy	1
if	1
he	1
liked;	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
dozen	1
ways	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
cheapen	1
the	1
production	1
of	1
a	1
house	1
without	1
spoiling	1
the	1
effect.	1
He	1
awaited,	1
therefore,	1
his	1
opportunity	1
till	1
Irene	1
was	1
handing	1
the	1
architect	1
his	1
first	1
cup	1
of	1
tea.	1
A	1
chink	1
of	1
sunshine	1
through	1
the	1
lace	1
of	1
the	1
blinds	1
warmed	1
her	1
cheek,	1
shone	1
in	1
the	1
gold	1
of	1
her	1
hair,	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
soft	1
eyes.	1
Possibly	1
the	1
same	1
gleam	1
deepened	1
Bosinney’s	1
colour,	1
gave	1
the	1
rather	1
startled	1
look	1
to	1
his	1
face.	1
Soames	1
hated	1
sunshine,	1
and	1
he	1
at	1
once	1
got	1
up,	1
to	1
draw	1
the	1
blind.	1
Then	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
own	1
cup	1
of	1
tea	1
from	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
said,	1
more	1
coldly	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
intended:	1
“Can’t	1
you	1
see	1
your	1
way	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
for	1
eight	1
thousand	1
after	1
all?	1
There	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
little	1
things	1
you	1
could	1
alter.”	1
Bosinney	1
drank	1
off	1
his	1
tea	1
at	1
a	1
gulp,	1
put	1
down	1
his	1
cup,	1
and	1
answered:	1
“Not	1
one!”	1
Soames	1
saw	1
that	1
his	1
suggestion	1
had	1
touched	1
some	1
unintelligible	1
point	1
of	1
personal	1
vanity.	1
“Well,”	1
he	1
agreed,	1
with	1
sulky	1
resignation;	1
“you	1
must	1
have	1
it	1
your	1
own	1
way,	1
I	1
suppose.”	1
A	1
few	1
minutes	1
later	1
Bosinney	1
rose	1
to	1
go,	1
and	1
Soames	1
rose	1
too,	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
off	1
the	1
premises.	1
The	1
architect	1
seemed	1
in	1
absurdly	1
high	1
spirits.	1
After	1
watching	1
him	1
walk	1
away	1
at	1
a	1
swinging	1
pace,	1
Soames	1
returned	1
moodily	1
to	1
the	1
drawing-room,	1
where	1
Irene	1
was	1
putting	1
away	1
the	1
music,	1
and,	1
moved	1
by	1
an	1
uncontrollable	1
spasm	1
of	1
curiosity,	1
he	1
asked:	1
“Well,	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
‘The	1
Buccaneer’?”	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
carpet	1
while	1
waiting	1
for	1
her	1
answer,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
wait	1
some	1
time.	1
“I	1
don’t	1
know,”	1
she	1
said	1
at	1
last.	1
“Do	1
you	1
think	1
he’s	1
good-looking?”	1
Irene	1
smiled.	1
And	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Soames	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
mocking	1
him.	1
“Yes,”	1
she	1
answered;	1
“very.”	1
Chapter	1
9	1
Death	1
of	1
Aunt	1
Ann	1
There	1
came	1
a	1
morning	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
September	1
when	1
Aunt	1
Ann	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
take	1
from	1
Smither’s	1
hands	1
the	1
insignia	1
of	1
personal	1
dignity.	1
After	1
one	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
old	1
face,	1
the	1
doctor,	1
hurriedly	1
sent	1
for,	1
announced	1
that	1
Miss	1
Forsyte	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
in	1
her	1
sleep.	1
Aunts	1
Juley	1
and	1
Hester	1
were	1
overwhelmed	1
by	1
the	1
shock.	1
They	1
had	1
never	1
imagined	1
such	1
an	1
ending.	1
Indeed,	1
it	1
is	1
doubtful	1
whether	1
they	1
had	1
ever	1
realized	1
that	1
an	1
ending	1
was	1
bound	1
to	1
come.	1
Secretly	1
they	1
felt	1
it	1
unreasonable	1
of	1
Ann	1
to	1
have	1
left	1
them	1
like	1
this	1
without	1
a	1
word,	1
without	1
even	1
a	1
struggle.	1
It	1
was	1
unlike	1
her.	1
Perhaps	1
what	1
really	1
affected	1
them	1
so	1
profoundly	1
was	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
a	1
Forsyte	1
should	1
have	1
let	1
go	1
her	1
grasp	1
on	1
life.	1
If	1
one,	1
then	1
why	1
not	1
all!	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
full	1
hour	1
before	1
they	1
could	1
make	1
up	1
their	1
minds	1
to	1
tell	1
Timothy.	1
If	1
only	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
kept	1
from	1
him!	1
If	1
only	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
broken	1
to	1
him	1
by	1
degrees!	1
And	1
long	1
they	1
stood	1
outside	1
his	1
door	1
whispering	1
together.	1
And	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
over	1
they	1
whispered	1
together	1
again.	1
He	1
would	1
feel	1
it	1
more,	1
they	1
were	1
afraid,	1
as	1
time	1
went	1
on.	1
Still,	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
it	1
better	1
than	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
expected.	1
He	1
would	1
keep	1
his	1
bed,	1
of	1
course!	1
They	1
separated,	1
crying	1
quietly.	1
Aunt	1
Juley	1
stayed	1
in	1
her	1
room,	1
prostrated	1
by	1
the	1
blow.	1
Her	1
face,	1
discoloured	1
by	1
tears,	1
was	1
divided	1
into	1
compartments	1
by	1
the	1
little	1
ridges	1
of	1
pouting	1
flesh	1
which	1
had	1
swollen	1
with	1
emotion.	1
It	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
conceive	1
of	1
life	1
without	1
Ann,	1
who	1
had	1
lived	1
with	1
her	1
for	1
seventy-three	1
years,	1
broken	1
only	1
by	1
the	1
short	1
interregnum	1
of	1
her	1
married	1
life,	1
which	1
seemed	1
now	1
so	1
unreal.	1
At	1
fixed	1
intervals	1
she	1
went	1
to	1
her	1
drawer,	1
and	1
took	1
from	1
beneath	1
the	1
lavender	1
bags	1
a	1
fresh	1
pocket-handkerchief.	1
Her	1
warm	1
heart	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
Ann	1
was	1
lying	1
there	1
so	1
cold.	1
Aunt	1
Hester,	1
the	1
silent,	1
the	1
patient,	1
that	1
backwater	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
energy,	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
drawing-room,	1
where	1
the	1
blinds	1
were	1
drawn;	1
and	1
she,	1
too,	1
had	1
wept	1
at	1
first,	1
but	1
quietly,	1
without	1
visible	1
effect.	1
Her	1
guiding	1
principle,	1
the	1
conservation	1
of	1
energy,	1
did	1
not	1
abandon	1
her	1
in	1
sorrow.	1
She	1
sat,	1
slim,	1
motionless,	1
studying	1
the	1
grate,	1
her	1
hands	1
idle	1
in	1
the	1
lap	1
of	1
her	1
black	1
silk	1
dress.	1
They	1
would	1
want	1
to	1
rouse	1
her	1
into	1
doing	1
something,	1
no	1
doubt.	1
As	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
any	1
good	1
in	1
that!	1
Doing	1
something	1
would	1
not	1
bring	1
back	1
Ann!	1
Why	1
worry	1
her?	1
Five	1
o’clock	1
brought	1
three	1
of	1
the	1
brothers,	1
Jolyon	1
and	1
James	1
and	1
Swithin;	1
Nicholas	1
was	1
at	1
Yarmouth,	1
and	1
Roger	1
had	1
a	1
bad	1
attack	1
of	1
gout.	1
Mrs.	1
Hayman	1
had	1
been	1
by	1
herself	1
earlier	1
in	1
the	1
day,	1
and,	1
after	1
seeing	1
Ann,	1
had	1
gone	1
away,	1
leaving	1
a	1
message	1
for	1
Timothy	1
—	1
which	1
was	1
kept	1
from	1
him	1
—	1
that	1
she	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
told	1
sooner.	1
In	1
fact,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
feeling	1
amongst	1
them	1
all	1
that	1
they	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
told	1
sooner,	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
had	1
missed	1
something;	1
and	1
James	1
said:	1
“I	1
knew	1
how	1
it’d	1
be;	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
she	1
wouldn’t	1
last	1
through	1
the	1
summer.”	1
Aunt	1
Hester	1
made	1
no	1
reply;	1
it	1
was	1
nearly	1
October,	1
but	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
arguing;	1
some	1
people	1
were	1
never	1
satisfied.	1
She	1
sent	1
up	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
sister	1
that	1
the	1
brothers	1
were	1
there.	1
Mrs.	1
Small	1
came	1
down	1
at	1
once.	1
She	1
had	1
bathed	1
her	1
face,	1
which	1
was	1
still	1
swollen,	1
and	1
though	1
she	1
looked	1
severely	1
at	1
Swithin’s	1
trousers,	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
of	1
light	1
blue	1
—	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
straight	1
from	1
the	1
club,	1
where	1
the	1
news	1
had	1
reached	1
him	1
—	1
she	1
wore	1
a	1
more	1
cheerful	1
expression	1
than	1
usual,	1
the	1
instinct	1
for	1
doing	1
the	1
wrong	1
thing	1
being	1
even	1
now	1
too	1
strong	1
for	1
her.	1
Presently	1
all	1
five	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
body.	1
Under	1
the	1
pure	1
white	1
sheet	1
a	1
quilted	1
counter-pane	1
had	1
been	1
placed,	1
for	1
now,	1
more	1
than	1
ever,	1
Aunt	1
Ann	1
had	1
need	1
of	1
warmth;	1
and,	1
the	1
pillows	1
removed,	1
her	1
spine	1
and	1
head	1
rested	1
flat,	1
with	1
the	1
semblance	1
of	1
their	1
life-long	1
inflexibility;	1
the	1
coif	1
banding	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
her	1
brow	1
was	1
drawn	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
to	1
the	1
level	1
of	1
the	1
ears,	1
and	1
between	1
it	1
and	1
the	1
sheet	1
her	1
face,	1
almost	1
as	1
white,	1
was	1
turned	1
with	1
closed	1
eyes	1
to	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
her	1
brothers	1
and	1
sisters.	1
In	1
its	1
extraordinary	1
peace	1
the	1
face	1
was	1
stronger	1
than	1
ever,	1
nearly	1
all	1
bone	1
now	1
under	1
the	1
scarce-wrinkled	1
parchment	1
of	1
skin	1
—	1
square	1
jaw	1
and	1
chin,	1
cheekbones,	1
forehead	1
with	1
hollow	1
temples,	1
chiselled	1
nose	1
—	1
the	1
fortress	1
of	1
an	1
unconquerable	1
spirit	1
that	1
had	1
yielded	1
to	1
death,	1
and	1
in	1
its	1
upward	1
sightlessness	1
seemed	1
trying	1
to	1
regain	1
that	1
spirit,	1
to	1
regain	1
the	1
guardianship	1
it	1
had	1
just	1
laid	1
down.	1
Swithin	1
took	1
but	1
one	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
face,	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
room;	1
the	1
sight,	1
he	1
said	1
afterwards,	1
made	1
him	1
very	1
queer.	1
He	1
went	1
downstairs	1
shaking	1
the	1
whole	1
house,	1
and,	1
seizing	1
his	1
hat,	1
clambered	1
into	1
his	1
brougham,	1
without	1
giving	1
any	1
directions	1
to	1
the	1
coachman.	1
He	1
was	1
driven	1
home,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
evening	1
sat	1
in	1
his	1
chair	1
without	1
moving.	1
He	1
could	1
take	1
nothing	1
for	1
dinner	1
but	1
a	1
partridge,	1
with	1
an	1
imperial	1
pint	1
of	1
champagne.	1
.	3
Old	1
Jolyon	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
bed,	1
his	1
hands	1
folded	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him.	1
He	1
alone	1
of	1
those	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
remembered	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
Ann,	1
it	1
was	1
of	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
thinking.	1
Ann	1
was	1
an	1
old	1
woman,	1
but	1
death	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
her	1
at	1
last	1
—	1
death	1
came	1
to	1
all!	1
His	1
face	1
did	1
not	1
move,	1
his	1
gaze	1
seemed	1
travelling	1
from	1
very	1
far.	1
Aunt	1
Hester	1
stood	1
beside	1
him.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
cry	1
now,	1
tears	1
were	1
exhausted	1
—	1
her	1
nature	1
refused	1
to	1
permit	1
a	1
further	1
escape	1
of	1
force;	1
she	1
twisted	1
her	1
hands,	1
looking	1
not	1
at	1
Ann,	1
but	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side,	1
seeking	1
some	1
way	1
of	1
escaping	1
the	1
effort	1
of	1
realization.	1
Of	1
all	1
the	1
brothers	1
and	1
sisters	1
James	1
manifested	1
the	1
most	1
emotion.	1
Tears	1
rolled	1
down	1
the	1
parallel	1
furrows	1
of	1
his	1
thin	1
face;	1
where	1
he	1
should	1
go	1
now	1
to	1
tell	1
his	1
troubles	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know;	1
Juley	1
was	1
no	1
good,	1
Hester	1
worse	1
than	1
useless!	1
He	1
felt	1
Ann’s	1
death	1
more	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
thought	1
he	1
should;	1
this	1
would	1
upset	1
him	1
for	1
weeks!	1
Presently	1
Aunt	1
Hester	1
stole	1
out,	1
and	1
Aunt	1
Juley	1
began	1
moving	1
about,	1
doing	1
‘what	1
was	1
necessary,’	1
so	1
that	1
twice	1
she	1
knocked	1
against	1
something.	1
Old	1
Jolyon,	1
roused	1
from	1
his	1
reverie,	1
that	1
reverie	1
of	1
the	1
long,	1
long	1
past,	1
looked	1
sternly	1
at	1
her,	1
and	1
went	1
away.	1
James	1
alone	1
was	1
left	1
by	1
the	1
bedside;	1
glancing	1
stealthily	1
round,	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
observed,	1
he	1
twisted	1
his	1
long	1
body	1
down,	1
placed	1
a	1
kiss	1
on	1
the	1
dead	1
forehead,	1
then	1
he,	1
too,	1
hastily	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
Encountering	1
Smither	1
in	1
the	1
hall,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
ask	1
her	1
about	1
the	1
funeral,	1
and,	1
finding	1
that	1
she	1
knew	1
nothing,	1
complained	1
bitterly	1
that,	1
if	1
they	1
didn’t	1
take	1
care,	1
everything	1
would	1
go	1
wrong.	1
She	1
had	1
better	1
send	1
for	1
Mr.	1
Soames	1
—	1
he	1
knew	1
all	1
about	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
thing;	1
her	1
master	1
was	1
very	1
much	1
upset,	1
he	1
supposed	1
—	1
he	1
would	1
want	1
looking	1
after;	1
as	1
for	1
her	1
mistresses,	1
they	1
were	1
no	1
good	1
—	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
gumption!	1
They	1
would	1
be	1
ill	1
too,	1
he	1
shouldn’t	1
wonder.	1
She	1
had	1
better	1
send	1
for	1
the	1
doctor;	1
it	1
was	1
best	1
to	1
take	1
things	1
in	1
time.	1
He	1
didn’t	1
think	1
his	1
sister	1
Ann	1
had	2
the	1
best	1
opinion;	1
if	1
she’d	1
had	1
Blank	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
alive	1
now.	1
Smither	1
might	1
send	1
to	1
Park	1
Lane	1
any	1
time	1
she	1
wanted	1
advice.	1
Of	1
course,	1
his	1
carriage	1
was	1
at	1
their	1
service	1
for	1
the	1
funeral.	1
He	1
supposed	1
she	1
hadn’t	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
as	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
claret	1
and	1
a	1
biscuit	1
—	1
he	1
had	2
no	1
lunch!	1
The	1
days	1
before	1
the	1
funeral	1
passed	1
quietly.	1
It	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
known,	1
of	1
course,	1
that	1
Aunt	1
Ann	1
had	1
left	1
her	1
little	1
property	1
to	1
Timothy.	1
There	1
was,	1
therefore,	1
no	1
reason	1
for	1
the	1
slightest	1
agitation.	1
Soames,	1
who	1
was	1
sole	1
executor,	1
took	1
charge	1
of	1
all	1
arrangements,	1
and	1
in	1
due	1
course	1
sent	1
out	1
the	1
following	1
invitation	1
to	1
every	1
male	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
family:	1
To.	1
.	10
Your	1
presence	1
is	1
requested	1
at	1
the	1
funeral	1
of	1
Miss	1
Ann	1
Forsyte,	1
in	1
Highgate	1
Cemetery,	1
at	1
noon	1
of	1
Oct.	1
1st.	1
Carriages	1
will	1
meet	1
at	1
“The	1
Bower,”	1
Bayswater	1
Road,	1
at	1
10.45.	1
No	1
flowers	1
by	1
request.	1
‘R.S.V.P.’	1
The	1
morning	1
came,	1
cold,	1
with	1
a	1
high,	1
grey,	1
London	1
sky,	1
and	1
at	1
half-past	1
ten	1
the	1
first	1
carriage,	1
that	1
of	1
James,	1
drove	1
up.	1
It	1
contained	1
James	1
and	1
his	1
son-in-law	1
Dartie,	1
a	1
fine	1
man,	1
with	1
a	1
square	1
chest,	1
buttoned	1
very	1
tightly	1
into	1
a	1
frock	1
coat,	1
and	1
a	1
sallow,	1
fattish	1
face	1
adorned	1
with	1
dark,	1
well-curled	1
moustaches,	1
and	1
that	1
incorrigible	1
commencement	1
of	1
whisker	1
which,	1
eluding	1
the	1
strictest	1
attempts	1
at	1
shaving,	1
seems	1
the	1
mark	1
of	1
something	1
deeply	1
ingrained	1
in	1
the	1
personality	1
of	1
the	1
shaver,	1
being	1
especially	1
noticeable	1
in	1
men	1
who	1
speculate.	1
Soames,	1
in	1
his	1
capacity	1
of	1
executor,	1
received	1
the	1
guests,	1
for	1
Timothy	1
still	1
kept	1
his	1
bed;	1
he	1
would	1
get	1
up	1
after	1
the	1
funeral;	1
and	1
Aunts	1
Juley	1
and	1
Hester	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
coming	1
down	1
till	1
all	1
was	1
over,	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
understood	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
lunch	1
for	1
anyone	1
who	1
cared	1
to	1
come	1
back.	1
The	1
next	1
to	1
arrive	1
was	1
Roger,	1
still	1
limping	1
from	1
the	1
gout,	1
and	1
encircled	1
by	1
three	1
of	1
his	1
sons	1
—	1
young	1
Roger,	1
Eustace,	1
and	1
Thomas.	1
George,	1
the	1
remaining	1
son,	1
arrived	1
almost	1
immediately	1
afterwards	1
in	1
a	1
hansom,	1
and	1
paused	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
to	1
ask	1
Soames	1
how	1
he	1
found	1
undertaking	1
pay.	1
They	1
disliked	1
each	1
other.	1
Then	1
came	1
two	1
Haymans	1
—	1
Giles	1
and	1
Jesse	1
perfectly	1
silent,	1
and	1
very	1
well	1
dressed,	1
with	1
special	1
creases	1
down	1
their	1
evening	1
trousers.	1
Then	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
alone.	1
Next,	1
Nicholas,	1
with	1
a	1
healthy	1
colour	1
in	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
a	1
carefully	1
veiled	1
sprightliness	1
in	1
every	1
movement	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
body.	1
One	1
of	1
his	1
sons	1
followed	1
him,	1
meek	1
and	1
subdued.	1
Swithin	1
Forsyte,	1
and	1
Bosinney	1
arrived	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
—	1
and	1
stood	1
—	1
bowing	1
precedence	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
—	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
door	1
opening	1
they	1
tried	1
to	1
enter	1
together;	1
they	1
renewed	1
their	1
apologies	1
in	1
the	1
hall,	1
and,	1
Swithin,	1
settling	1
his	1
stock,	1
which	1
had	1
become	1
disarranged	1
in	1
the	1
struggle,	1
very	1
slowly	1
mounted	1
the	1
stairs.	1
The	1
other	1
Hayman;	1
two	1
married	1
sons	1
of	1
Nicholas,	1
together	1
with	1
Tweetyman,	1
Spender,	1
and	1
Warry,	1
the	1
husbands	1
of	1
married	1
Forsyte	1
and	1
Hayman	1
daughters.	1
The	1
company	1
was	1
then	1
complete,	1
twenty-one	1
in	1
all,	1
not	1
a	1
male	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
being	1
absent	1
but	1
Timothy	1
and	1
young	1
Jolyon.	1
Entering	1
the	1
scarlet	1
and	1
green	1
drawing-room,	1
whose	1
apparel	1
made	1
so	1
vivid	1
a	1
setting	1
for	1
their	1
unaccustomed	1
costumes,	1
each	1
tried	1
nervously	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
seat,	1
desirous	1
of	1
hiding	1
the	1
emphatic	1
blackness	1
of	1
his	1
trousers.	1
There	1
seemed	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
indecency	1
in	1
that	1
blackness	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
colour	1
of	1
their	1
gloves	1
—	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
exaggeration	1
of	1
the	1
feelings;	1
and	1
many	1
cast	1
shocked	1
looks	1
of	1
secret	1
envy	1
at	1
‘the	1
Buccaneer,’	1
who	1
had	1
no	1
gloves,	1
and	1
was	1
wearing	1
grey	1
trousers.	1
A	1
subdued	1
hum	1
of	1
conversation	1
rose,	1
no	1
one	1
speaking	1
of	1
the	1
departed,	1
but	1
each	1
asking	1
after	1
the	1
other,	1
as	1
though	1
thereby	1
casting	1
an	1
indirect	1
libation	1
to	1
this	1
event,	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
honour.	1
And	1
presently	1
James	1
said:	1
“Well,	1
I	1
think	1
we	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
starting.”	1
They	1
went	1
downstairs,	1
and,	1
two	1
and	1
two,	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
off	1
in	1
strict	1
precedence,	1
mounted	1
the	1
carriages.	1
The	1
hearse	1
started	1
at	1
a	1
foot’s	1
pace;	1
the	1
carriages	1
moved	1
slowly	1
after.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
went	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
with	1
Nicholas;	1
in	1
the	1
second,	1
the	1
twins,	1
Swithin	1
and	1
James;	1
in	1
the	1
third,	1
Roger	1
and	1
young	1
Roger;	1
Soames,	1
young	1
Nicholas,	1
George,	1
and	1
Bosinney	1
followed	1
in	1
the	1
fourth.	1
Each	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
carriages,	1
eight	1
in	1
all,	1
held	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
of	1
the	1
family;	1
behind	1
them	1
came	1
the	1
doctor’s	1
brougham;	1
then,	1
at	1
a	1
decent	1
interval,	1
cabs	1
containing	1
family	1
clerks	1
and	1
servants;	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
end,	1
one	1
containing	1
nobody	1
at	1
all,	1
but	1
bringing	1
the	1
total	1
cortege	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
thirteen.	1
So	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
procession	1
kept	1
to	1
the	1
highway	1
of	1
the	1
Bayswater	1
Road,	1
it	1
retained	1
the	1
foot’s-pace,	1
but,	1
turning	1
into	1
less	1
important	1
thorough-fares,	1
it	1
soon	1
broke	1
into	1
a	1
trot,	1
and	1
so	1
proceeded,	1
with	1
intervals	1
of	1
walking	1
in	1
the	1
more	1
fashionable	1
streets,	1
until	1
it	1
arrived.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
carriage	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
and	1
Nicholas	1
were	1
talking	1
of	1
their	1
wills.	1
In	1
the	1
second	1
the	1
twins,	1
after	1
a	1
single	1
attempt,	1
had	1
lapsed	1
into	1
complete	1
silence;	1
both	1
were	1
rather	1
deaf,	1
and	1
the	1
exertion	1
of	1
making	1
themselves	1
heard	1
was	1
too	1
great.	1
Only	1
once	1
James	1
broke	1
this	1
silence:	1
“I	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
looking	1
about	1
for	1
some	1
ground	1
somewhere.	1
What	1
arrangements	1
have	1
you	1
made,	1
Swithin?”	1
And	1
Swithin,	1
fixing	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
dreadful	1
stare,	1
answered:	1
“Don’t	1
talk	1
to	1
me	1
about	1
such	1
things!”	1
In	1
the	1
third	1
carriage	1
a	1
disjointed	1
conversation	1
was	1
carried	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
intervals	1
of	1
looking	1
out	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
far	1
they	1
had	1
got,	1
George	1
remarking,	1
“Well,	1
it	1
was	1
really	1
time	1
that	1
the	1
poor	1
old	1
lady	1
went.”	1
He	1
didn’t	1
believe	1
in	1
people	1
living	1
beyond	1
seventy,	1
Young	1
Nicholas	1
replied	1
mildly	1
that	1
the	1
rule	1
didn’t	1
seem	1
to	1
apply	1
to	1
the	1
Forsytes.	1
George	1
said	1
he	1
himself	1
intended	1
to	1
commit	1
suicide	1
at	1
sixty.	1
Young	1
Nicholas,	1
smiling	1
and	1
stroking	1
a	1
long	1
chin,	1
didn’t	1
think	1
his	1
father	1
would	1
like	1
that	1
theory;	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
money	1
since	1
he	1
was	1
sixty.	1
Well,	1
seventy	1
was	1
the	1
outside	1
limit;	1
it	1
was	1
then	1
time,	1
George	1
said,	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
leave	1
their	1
money	1
to	1
their	1
children.	1
Soames,	1
hitherto	1
silent,	1
here	1
joined	1
in;	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
forgotten	1
the	1
remark	1
about	1
the	1
‘undertaking,’	1
and,	1
lifting	1
his	1
eyelids	1
almost	1
imperceptibly,	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
very	1
well	1
for	1
people	1
who	1
never	1
made	1
money	1
to	1
talk.	1
He	1
himself	1
intended	1
to	1
live	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
could.	1
This	1
was	1
a	1
hit	1
at	1
George,	1
who	1
was	1
notoriously	1
hard	1
up.	1
Bosinney	1
muttered	1
abstractedly	1
“Hear,	1
hear!”	1
and,	1
George	1
yawning,	1
the	1
conversation	1
dropped.	1
Upon	1
arriving,	1
the	1
coffin	1
was	1
borne	1
into	1
the	1
chapel,	1
and,	1
two	1
by	1
two,	1
the	1
mourners	1
filed	1
in	1
behind	1
it.	1
This	1
guard	1
of	1
men,	1
all	1
attached	1
to	1
the	1
dead	1
by	1
the	1
bond	1
of	1
kinship,	1
was	1
an	1
impressive	1
and	1
singular	1
sight	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
city	1
of	1
London,	1
with	1
its	1
overwhelming	1
diversity	1
of	1
life,	1
its	1
innumerable	1
vocations,	1
pleasures,	1
duties,	1
its	1
terrible	1
hardness,	1
its	1
terrible	1
call	1
to	1
individualism.	1
The	1
family	1
had	1
gathered	1
to	1
triumph	1
over	1
all	1
this,	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
show	1
of	1
tenacious	1
unity,	1
to	1
illustrate	1
gloriously	1
that	1
law	1
of	1
property	1
underlying	1
the	1
growth	1
of	1
their	1
tree,	1
by	1
which	1
it	1
had	1
thriven	1
and	1
spread,	1
trunk	1
and	1
branches,	1
the	1
sap	1
flowing	1
through	1
all,	1
the	1
full	1
growth	1
reached	1
at	1
the	1
appointed	1
time.	1
The	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
woman	1
lying	1
in	1
her	1
last	1
sleep	1
had	1
called	1
them	1
to	1
this	1
demonstration.	1
It	1
was	1
her	1
final	1
appeal	1
to	1
that	1
unity	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
their	1
strength	1
—	1
it	1
was	1
her	1
final	1
triumph	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
died	1
while	1
the	1
tree	1
was	1
yet	1
whole.	1
She	1
was	1
spared	1
the	1
watching	1
of	1
the	1
branches	1
jut	1
out	1
beyond	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
balance.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
look	1
into	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
her	1
followers.	1
The	1
same	1
law	1
that	1
had	1
worked	1
in	1
her,	1
bringing	1
her	1
up	1
from	1
a	1
tall,	1
straight-backed	1
slip	1
of	1
a	1
girl	1
to	1
a	1
woman	1
strong	1
and	1
grown,	1
from	1
a	1
woman	1
grown	1
to	1
a	1
woman	1
old,	1
angular,	1
feeble,	1
almost	1
witchlike,	1
with	1
individuality	1
all	1
sharpened	1
and	1
sharpened,	1
as	1
all	1
rounding	1
from	1
the	1
world’s	1
contact	1
fell	1
off	1
from	1
her	1
—	1
that	1
same	1
law	1
would	1
work,	1
was	1
working,	1
in	1
the	1
family	1
she	1
had	1
watched	1
like	1
a	1
mother.	1
She	1
had	1
seen	1
it	1
young,	1
and	1
growing,	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
it	1
strong	1
and	1
grown,	1
and	1
before	1
her	1
old	1
eyes	1
had	1
time	1
or	1
strength	1
to	1
see	1
any	1
more,	1
she	1
died.	1
She	1
would	1
have	1
tried,	1
and	1
who	1
knows	1
but	1
she	1
might	1
have	1
kept	1
it	1
young	1
and	1
strong,	1
with	1
her	1
old	1
fingers,	1
her	1
trembling	1
kisses	1
—	1
a	1
little	1
longer;	1
alas!	1
not	1
even	1
Aunt	1
Ann	1
could	1
fight	1
with	1
Nature.	1
‘Pride	1
comes	1
before	1
a	1
fall!’	1
In	1
accordance	1
with	1
this,	1
the	1
greatest	1
of	1
Nature’s	1
ironies,	1
the	1
Forsyte	1
family	1
had	1
gathered	1
for	1
a	1
last	1
proud	1
pageant	1
before	1
they	1
fell.	1
Their	1
faces	1
to	1
right	1
and	1
left,	1
in	1
single	1
lines,	1
were	1
turned	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
impassively	1
toward	1
the	1
ground,	1
guardians	1
of	1
their	1
thoughts;	1
but	1
here	1
and	1
there,	1
one	1
looking	1
upward,	1
with	1
a	1
line	1
between	1
his	1
brows,	1
searched	1
to	1
see	1
some	1
sight	1
on	1
the	1
chapel	1
walls	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
him,	1
to	1
be	1
listening	1
to	1
something	1
that	1
appalled.	1
And	1
the	1
responses,	1
low-muttered,	1
in	1
voices	1
through	1
which	1
rose	1
the	1
same	1
tone,	1
the	1
same	1
unseizable	1
family	1
ring,	1
sounded	1
weird,	1
as	1
though	1
murmured	1
in	1
hurried	1
duplication	1
by	1
a	1
single	1
person.	1
The	1
service	1
in	1
the	1
chapel	1
over,	1
the	1
mourners	1
filed	1
up	1
again	1
to	1
guard	1
the	1
body	1
to	1
the	1
tomb.	1
The	1
vault	1
stood	1
open,	1
and,	1
round	1
it,	1
men	1
in	1
black	1
were	1
waiting.	1
From	1
that	1
high	1
and	1
sacred	1
field,	1
where	1
thousands	1
of	1
the	1
upper	1
middle	1
class	1
lay	1
in	1
their	1
last	1
sleep,	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
Forsytes	1
travelled	1
down	1
across	1
the	1
flocks	1
of	1
graves.	1
There	1
—	1
spreading	1
to	1
the	1
distance,	1
lay	1
London,	1
with	1
no	1
sun	1
over	1
it,	1
mourning	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
its	1
daughter,	1
mourning	1
with	1
this	1
family,	1
so	1
dear,	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
her	1
who	1
was	1
mother	1
and	1
guardian.	1
A	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
spires	1
and	1
houses,	1
blurred	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
grey	1
web	1
of	1
property,	1
lay	1
there	1
like	1
prostrate	1
worshippers	1
before	1
the	1
grave	1
of	1
this,	1
the	1
oldest	1
Forsyte	1
of	1
them	1
all.	1
A	1
few	1
words,	1
a	1
sprinkle	1
of	1
earth,	1
the	1
thrusting	1
of	1
the	1
coffin	1
home,	1
and	1
Aunt	1
Ann	1
had	1
passed	1
to	1
her	1
last	1
rest.	1
Round	1
the	1
vault,	1
trustees	1
of	1
that	1
passing,	1
the	1
five	1
brothers	1
stood,	1
with	1
white	1
heads	1
bowed;	1
they	1
would	1
see	1
that	1
Ann	1
was	1
comfortable	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
going.	1
Her	1
little	1
property	1
must	1
stay	1
behind,	1
but	1
otherwise,	1
all	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
should	1
be	1
done.	1
.	3
Then	1
severally,	1
each	1
stood	1
aside,	1
and	1
putting	1
on	1
his	1
hat,	1
turned	1
back	1
to	1
inspect	1
the	1
new	1
inscription	1
on	1
the	1
marble	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
vault:	1
SACRED	1
TO	1
THE	1
MEMORY	1
OF	1
ANN	1
FORSYTE,	1
THE	1
DAUGHTER	1
OF	1
THE	1
ABOVE	1
JOLYON	1
AND	1
ANN	1
FORSYTE,	1
WHO	1
DEPARTED	1
THIS	1
LIFE	1
THE	1
27TH	1
DAY	1
OF	1
SEPTEMBER,	1
1886,	1
AGED	1
EIGHTY-SEVEN	1
YEARS	1
AND	1
FOUR	1
DAYS	1
Soon	1
perhaps,	1
someone	1
else	1
would	1
be	1
wanting	1
an	1
inscription.	1
It	1
was	1
strange	1
and	1
intolerable,	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
thought	1
somehow,	1
that	1
Forsytes	1
could	1
die.	1
And	1
one	1
and	1
all	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
longing	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
from	1
this	1
painfulness,	1
this	1
ceremony	1
which	1
had	1
reminded	1
them	1
of	1
things	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
—	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
quickly	1
and	1
go	1
about	1
their	1
business	1
and	1
forget.	1
It	1
was	1
cold,	1
too;	1
the	1
wind,	1
like	1
some	1
slow,	1
disintegrating	1
force,	1
blowing	1
up	1
the	1
hill	1
over	1
the	1
graves,	1
struck	1
them	1
with	1
its	1
chilly	1
breath;	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
split	1
into	1
groups,	1
and	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible	1
to	1
fill	1
the	1
waiting	1
carriages.	1
Swithin	1
said	1
he	1
should	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
lunch	1
at	1
Timothy’s,	1
and	1
he	1
offered	1
to	1
take	1
anybody	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
brougham.	1
It	1
was	1
considered	1
a	1
doubtful	1
privilege	1
to	1
drive	1
with	1
Swithin	1
in	1
his	1
brougham,	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
large	1
one;	1
nobody	1
accepted,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
off	1
alone.	1
James	1
and	1
Roger	1
followed	1
immediately	1
after;	1
they	1
also	1
would	1
drop	1
in	1
to	1
lunch.	1
The	1
others	1
gradually	1
melted	1
away,	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
taking	1
three	1
nephews	1
to	1
fill	1
up	1
his	1
carriage;	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
want	1
of	1
those	1
young	1
faces.	1
Soames,	1
who	1
had	1
to	1
arrange	1
some	1
details	1
in	1
the	1
cemetery	1
office,	1
walked	1
away	1
with	1
Bosinney.	1
He	1
had	1
much	1
to	1
talk	1
over	1
with	1
him,	1
and,	1
having	1
finished	1
his	1
business,	1
they	1
strolled	1
to	1
Hampstead,	1
lunched	1
together	1
at	1
the	1
Spaniard’s	1
Inn,	1
and	1
spent	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
in	1
going	1
into	1
practical	1
details	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
building	1
of	1
the	1
house;	1
they	1
then	1
proceeded	1
to	1
the	1
tram-line,	1
and	1
came	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
Marble	1
Arch,	1
where	1
Bosinney	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
Stanhope	1
Gate	1
to	1
see	1
June.	1
Soames	1
felt	1
in	1
excellent	1
spirits	1
when	1
he	1
arrived	1
home,	1
and	1
confided	1
to	1
Irene	1
at	1
dinner	1
that	1
he	1
had	2
a	1
good	1
talk	1
with	1
Bosinney,	1
who	1
really	1
seemed	1
a	1
sensible	1
fellow;	1
they	1
had	2
a	1
capital	1
walk	1
too,	1
which	1
had	1
done	1
his	1
liver	1
good	1
—	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
short	1
of	1
exercise	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
—	1
and	1
altogether	1
a	1
very	1
satisfactory	1
day.	1
If	1
only	1
it	1
hadn’t	1
been	1
for	1
poor	1
Aunt	1
Ann,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
taken	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
theatre;	1
as	1
it	1
was,	1
they	1
must	1
make	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
an	1
evening	1
at	1
home.	1
“The	1
Buccaneer	1
asked	1
after	1
you	1
more	1
than	1
once,”	1
he	1
said	1
suddenly.	1
And	1
moved	1
by	1
some	1
inexplicable	1
desire	1
to	1
assert	1
his	1
proprietorship,	1
he	1
rose	1
from	1
his	1
chair	1
and	1
planted	1
a	1
kiss	1
on	1
his	1
wife’s	1
shoulder.	1

Progress	1
of	1
the	1
House	1
The	1
winter	1
had	1
been	1
an	1
open	1
one.	1
Things	1
in	1
the	1
trade	1
were	1
slack;	1
and	1
as	1
Soames	1
had	1
reflected	1
before	1
making	1
up	1
his	1
mind,	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
good	1
time	1
for	1
building.	1
The	1
shell	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
at	1
Robin	1
Hill	1
was	1
thus	1
completed	1
by	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
April.	1
Now	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
for	1
his	1
money,	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
coming	1
down	1
once,	1
twice,	1
even	1
three	1
times	1
a	1
week,	1
and	1
would	1
mouse	1
about	1
among	1
the	1
debris	1
for	1
hours,	1
careful	1
never	1
to	1
soil	1
his	1
clothes,	1
moving	1
silently	1
through	1
the	1
unfinished	1
brickwork	1
of	1
doorways,	1
or	1
circling	1
round	1
the	1
columns	1
in	1
the	1
central	1
court.	1
And	1
he	1
would	1
stand	1
before	1
them	1
for	1
minutes’	1
together,	1
as	1
though	1
peering	1
into	1
the	1
real	1
quality	1
of	1
their	1
substance.	1
On	1
April	1
30	1
he	1
had	1
an	1
appointment	1
with	1
Bosinney	1
to	1
go	1
over	1
the	1
accounts,	1
and	1
five	1
minutes	1
before	1
the	1
proper	1
time	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
tent	1
which	1
the	1
architect	1
had	1
pitched	1
for	1
himself	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
oak	1
tree.	1
The	1
accounts	1
were	1
already	1
prepared	1
on	1
a	1
folding	1
table,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
nod	1
Soames	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
study	1
them.	1
It	1
was	1
some	1
time	1
before	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
head.	1
“I	1
can’t	1
make	1
them	1
out,”	1
he	1
said	1
at	1
last;	1
“they	1
come	1
to	1
nearly	1
seven	1
hundred	1
more	1
than	1
they	1
ought”	1
After	1
a	1
glance	1
at	1
Bosinney’s	1
face	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
quickly:	1
“If	1
you	1
only	1
make	1
a	1
firm	1
stand	1
against	1
these	1
builder	1
chaps	1
you’ll	1
get	1
them	1
down.	1
They	1
stick	1
you	1
with	1
everything	1
if	1
you	1
don’t	1
look	1
sharp.	1
.	3
Take	1
ten	1
per	1
cent.	1
off	1
all	1
round.	1
I	1
shan’t	1
mind	1
it’s	1
coming	1
out	1
a	1
hundred	1
or	1
so	1
over	1
the	1
mark!”	1
Bosinney	1
shook	1
his	1
head:	1
“I’ve	1
taken	1
off	1
every	1
farthing	1
I	1
can!”	1
Soames	1
pushed	1
back	1
the	1
table	1
with	1
a	1
movement	1
of	1
anger,	1
which	1
sent	1
the	1
account	1
sheets	1
fluttering	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
“Then	1
all	1
I	1
can	1
say	1
is,”	1
he	1
flustered	1
out,	1
“you’ve	1
made	1
a	1
pretty	1
mess	1
of	1
it!”	1
“I’ve	1
told	1
you	1
a	1
dozen	1
times,”	1
Bosinney	1
answered	1
sharply,	1
“that	1
there’d	1
be	1
extras.	1
I’ve	1
pointed	1
them	1
out	1
to	1
you	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
again!”	1
“I	1
know	1
that,”	1
growled	1
Soames:	1
“I	1
shouldn’t	1
have	1
objected	1
to	1
a	1
ten	1
pound	1
note	1
here	1
and	1
there.	1
How	1
was	1
I	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
by	1
‘extras’	1
you	1
meant	1
seven	1
hundred	1
pounds?”	1
The	1
qualities	1
of	1
both	1
men	1
had	1
contributed	1
to	1
this	1
not-inconsiderable	1
discrepancy.	1
On	1
the	1
one	1
hand,	1
the	1
architect’s	1
devotion	1
to	1
his	1
idea,	1
to	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
a	1
house	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
created	1
and	1
believed	1
in	1
—	1
had	1
made	1
him	1
nervous	1
of	1
being	1
stopped,	1
or	1
forced	1
to	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
makeshifts;	1
on	1
the	1
other,	1
Soames’	1
not	1
less	1
true	1
and	1
wholehearted	1
devotion	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
best	1
article	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
obtained	1
for	1
the	1
money,	1
had	1
rendered	1
him	1
averse	1
to	1
believing	1
that	1
things	1
worth	1
thirteen	1
shillings	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
bought	1
with	1
twelve.	1
“I	1
wish	1
I’d	1
never	1
undertaken	1
your	1
house,”	1
said	1
Bosinney	1
suddenly.	1
“You	1
come	1
down	1
here	1
worrying	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
life.	1
You	1
want	1
double	1
the	1
value	1
for	1
your	1
money	1
anybody	1
else	1
would,	1
and	1
now	1
that	1
you’ve	1
got	1
a	1
house	1
that	1
for	1
its	1
size	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
beaten	1
in	1
the	1
county,	1
you	1
don’t	1
want	1
to	1
pay	1
for	1
it.	1
If	1
you’re	1
anxious	1
to	1
be	1
off	1
your	1
bargain,	1
I	1
daresay	1
I	1
can	1
find	1
the	1
balance	1
above	1
the	1
estimates	1
myself,	1
but	1
I’m	1
d	1
——	1
d	1
if	1
I	1
do	1
another	1
stroke	1
of	1
work	1
for	1
you!”	1
Soames	1
regained	1
his	1
composure.	1
Knowing	1
that	1
Bosinney	1
had	1
no	1
capital,	1
he	1
regarded	1
this	1
as	1
a	1
wild	1
suggestion.	1
He	1
saw,	1
too,	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
kept	1
indefinitely	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
house	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
set	1
his	1
heart,	1
and	1
just	1
at	1
the	1
crucial	1
point	1
when	1
the	1
architect’s	1
personal	1
care	1
made	1
all	1
the	1
difference.	1
In	1
the	1
meantime	1
there	1
was	1
Irene	1
to	1
be	1
thought	1
of!	1
She	1
had	1
been	1
very	1
queer	1
lately.	1
He	1
really	1
believed	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
because	1
she	1
had	1
taken	1
to	1
Bosinney	1
that	1
she	1
tolerated	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
at	1
all.	1
It	1
would	1
not	1
do	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
open	1
breach	1
with	1
her.	1
“You	1
needn’t	1
get	1
into	1
a	1
rage,”	1
he	1
said.	1
“If	1
I’m	1
willing	1
to	1
put	1
up	1
with	1
it,	1
I	1
suppose	1
you	1
needn’t	1
cry	1
out.	1
All	1
I	1
meant	1
was	1
that	1
when	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
a	1
thing	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
cost	1
so	1
much,	1
I	1
like	1
to	1
—	1
well,	1
in	1
fact,	1
I—	1
like	1
to	1
know	1
where	1
I	1
am.”	1
“Look	1
here!”	1
said	1
Bosinney,	1
and	1
Soames	1
was	1
both	1
annoyed	1
and	1
surprised	1
by	1
the	1
shrewdness	1
of	1
his	1
glance.	1
“You’ve	1
got	1
my	1
services	1
dirt	1
cheap.	1
For	1
the	1
kind	1
of	1
work	1
I’ve	1
put	1
into	1
this	1
house,	1
and	1
the	1
amount	1
of	1
time	1
I’ve	1
given	1
to	1
it,	1
you’d	1
have	1
had	1
to	1
pay	1
Littlemaster	1
or	1
some	1
other	1
fool	1
four	1
times	1
as	1
much.	1
What	1
you	1
want,	1
in	1
fact,	1
is	1
a	1
first-rate	1
man	1
for	1
a	1
fourth-rate	1
fee,	1
and	1
that’s	1
exactly	1
what	1
you’ve	1
got!”	1
Soames	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
really	1
meant	1
what	1
he	1
said,	1
and,	1
angry	1
though	1
he	1
was,	1
the	1
consequences	1
of	1
a	1
row	1
rose	1
before	1
him	1
too	1
vividly.	1
He	1
saw	1
his	1
house	1
unfinished,	1
his	1
wife	1
rebellious,	1
himself	1
a	1
laughingstock.	1
“Let’s	1
go	1
over	1
it,”	1
he	1
said	1
sulkily,	1
“and	1
see	1
how	1
the	1
money’s	1
gone.”	1
“Very	1
well,”	1
assented	1
Bosinney.	1
“But	1
we’ll	1
hurry	1
up,	1
if	1
you	1
don’t	1
mind.	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
get	1
back	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
take	1
June	1
to	1
the	1
theatre.”	1
Soames	1
cast	1
a	1
stealthy	1
look	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
said:	1
“Coming	1
to	1
our	1
place,	1
I	1
suppose	1
to	1
meet	1
her?”	1
He	1
was	1
always	1
coming	1
to	1
their	1
place!	1
There	1
had	1
been	1
rain	1
the	1
night	1
before-a	1
spring	1
rain,	1
and	1
the	1
earth	1
smelt	1
of	1
sap	1
and	1
wild	1
grasses.	1
The	1
warm,	1
soft	1
breeze	1
swung	1
the	1
leaves	1
and	1
the	1
golden	1
buds	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
oak	1
tree,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
sunshine	1
the	1
blackbirds	1
were	1
whistling	1
their	1
hearts	1
out.	1
It	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
spring	1
day	1
as	1
breathes	1
into	1
a	1
man	1
an	1
ineffable	1
yearning,	1
a	1
painful	1
sweetness,	1
a	1
longing	1
that	1
makes	1
him	1
stand	1
motionless,	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
leaves	1
or	1
grass,	1
and	1
fling	1
out	1
his	1
arms	1
to	1
embrace	1
he	1
knows	1
not	1
what.	1
The	1
earth	1
gave	1
forth	1
a	1
fainting	1
warmth,	1
stealing	1
up	1
through	1
the	1
chilly	1
garment	1
in	1
which	1
winter	1
had	1
wrapped	1
her.	1
It	1
was	1
her	1
long	1
caress	1
of	1
invitation,	1
to	1
draw	1
men	1
down	1
to	1
lie	1
within	1
her	1
arms,	1
to	1
roll	1
their	1
bodies	1
on	1
her,	1
and	1
put	1
their	1
lips	1
to	1
her	1
breast.	1
On	1
just	1
such	1
a	1
day	1
as	1
this	1
Soames	1
had	1
got	1
from	1
Irene	1
the	1
promise	1
he	1
had	1
asked	1
her	1
for	1
so	1
often.	1
Seated	1
on	1
the	1
fallen	1
trunk	1
of	1
a	1
tree,	1
he	1
had	1
promised	1
for	1
the	1
twentieth	1
time	1
that	1
if	1
their	1
marriage	1
were	1
not	1
a	1
success,	1
she	1
should	1
be	1
as	1
free	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
married	1
him!	1
“Do	1
you	1
swear	1
it?”	1
she	1
had	1
said.	1
A	1
few	1
days	1
back	1
she	1
had	1
reminded	1
him	1
of	1
that	1
oath.	1
He	1
had	1
answered:	1
“Nonsense!	1
I	1
couldn’t	1
have	1
sworn	1
any	1
such	1
thing!”	1
By	1
some	1
awkward	1
fatality	1
he	1
remembered	1
it	1
now.	1
What	1
queer	1
things	1
men	1
would	1
swear	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
women!	1
He	1
would	1
have	1
sworn	1
it	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
to	1
gain	1
her!	1
He	1
would	1
swear	1
it	1
now,	1
if	1
thereby	1
he	1
could	1
touch	1
her	1
—	1
but	1
nobody	1
could	1
touch	1
her,	1
she	1
was	1
cold-hearted!	1
And	1
memories	1
crowded	1
on	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
fresh,	1
sweet	1
savour	1
of	1
the	1
spring	1
wind-memories	1
of	1
his	1
courtship.	1
In	1
the	1
spring	1
of	1
the	1
year	1
1881	1
he	1
was	1
visiting	1
his	1
old	1
school-fellow	1
and	1
client,	1
George	1
Liversedge,	1
of	1
Branksome,	1
who,	1
with	1
the	1
view	1
of	1
developing	1
his	1
pine-woods	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
of	1
Bournemouth,	1
had	1
placed	1
the	1
formation	1
of	1
the	1
company	1
necessary	1
to	1
the	1
scheme	1
in	1
Soames’s	1
hands.	1
Mrs.	1
Liversedge,	1
with	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
fitness	1
of	1
things,	1
had	1
given	1
a	1
musical	1
tea	1
in	1
his	1
honour.	1
Later	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
this	1
function,	1
which	1
Soames,	1
no	1
musician,	1
had	1
regarded	1
as	1
an	1
unmitigated	1
bore,	1
his	1
eye	1
had	1
been	1
caught	1
by	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
girl	1
dressed	1
in	1
mourning,	1
standing	1
by	1
herself.	1
The	1
lines	1
of	1
her	1
tall,	1
as	1
yet	1
rather	1
thin	1
figure,	1
showed	1
through	1
the	1
wispy,	1
clinging	1
stuff	1
of	1
her	1
black	1
dress,	1
her	1
black-gloved	1
hands	1
were	1
crossed	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
her,	1
her	1
lips	1
slightly	1
parted,	1
and	1
her	1
large,	1
dark	1
eyes	1
wandered	1
from	1
face	1
to	1
face.	1
Her	1
hair,	1
done	1
low	1
on	1
her	1
neck,	1
seemed	1
to	1
gleam	1
above	1
her	1
black	1
collar	1
like	1
coils	1
of	1
shining	1
metal.	1
And	1
as	1
Soames	1
stood	1
looking	1
at	1
her,	1
the	1
sensation	1
that	1
most	1
men	1
have	1
felt	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
or	1
another	1
went	1
stealing	1
through	1
him	1
—	1
a	1
peculiar	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
the	1
senses,	1
a	1
peculiar	1
certainty,	1
which	1
novelists	1
and	1
old	1
ladies	1
call	1
love	1
at	1
first	1
sight.	1
Still	1
stealthily	1
watching	1
her,	1
he	1
at	1
once	1
made	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
his	1
hostess,	1
and	1
stood	1
doggedly	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
music	1
to	1
cease.	1
“Who	1
is	1
that	1
girl	1
with	1
yellow	1
hair	1
and	1
dark	1
eyes?”	1
he	1
asked.	1
“That	1
—	1
oh!	1
Irene	1
Heron.	1
Her	1
father,	1
Professor	1
Heron,	1
died	1
this	1
year.	1
She	1
lives	1
with	1
her	1
stepmother.	1
She’s	1
a	1
nice	1
girl,	1
a	1
pretty	1
girl,	1
but	1
no	1
money!”	1
“Introduce	1
me,	1
please,”	1
said	1
Soames.	1
It	1
was	1
very	1
little	1
that	1
he	1
found	1
to	1
say,	1
nor	1
did	1
he	1
find	1
her	1
responsive	1
to	1
that	1
little.	1
But	1
he	1
went	1
away	1
with	1
the	1
resolution	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
again.	1
He	1
effected	1
his	1
object	1
by	1
chance,	1
meeting	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
pier	1
with	1
her	1
stepmother,	1
who	1
had	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
walking	1
there	1
from	1
twelve	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
a	1
forenoon.	1
Soames	1
made	1
this	1
lady’s	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
alacrity,	1
nor	1
was	1
it	1
long	1
before	1
he	1
perceived	1
in	1
her	1
the	1
ally	1
he	1
was	1
looking	1
for.	1
His	1
keen	1
scent	1
for	1
the	1
commercial	1
side	1
of	1
family	1
life	1
soon	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
Irene	1
cost	1
her	1
stepmother	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
fifty	1
pounds	1
a	1
year	1
she	1
brought	1
her;	1
it	1
also	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
Mrs.	1
Heron,	1
a	1
woman	1
yet	1
in	1
the	1
prime	1
of	1
life,	1
desired	1
to	1
be	1
married	1
again.	1
The	1
strange	1
ripening	1
beauty	1
of	1
her	1
stepdaughter	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
this	1
desirable	1
consummation.	1
And	1
Soames,	1
in	1
his	1
stealthy	1
tenacity,	1
laid	1
his	1
plans.	1
He	1
left	1
Bournemouth	1
without	1
having	1
given	1
himself	1
away,	1
but	1
in	1
a	1
month’s	1
time	1
came	1
back,	1
and	1
this	1
time	1
he	1
spoke,	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
girl,	1
but	1
to	1
her	1
stepmother.	1
He	1
had	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind,	1
he	1
said;	1
he	1
would	1
wait	1
any	1
time.	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
to	1
wait,	1
watching	1
Irene	1
bloom,	1
the	1
lines	1
of	1
her	1
young	1
figure	1
softening,	1
the	1
stronger	1
blood	1
deepening	1
the	1
gleam	1
of	1
her	1
eyes,	1
and	1
warming	1
her	1
face	1
to	1
a	1
creamy	1
glow;	1
and	1
at	1
each	1
visit	1
he	1
proposed	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
when	1
that	1
visit	1
was	1
at	1
an	1
end,	1
took	1
her	1
refusal	1
away	1
with	1
him,	1
back	1
to	1
London,	1
sore	1
at	1
heart,	1
but	1
steadfast	1
and	1
silent	1
as	1
the	1
grave.	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
come	1
at	1
the	1
secret	1
springs	1
of	1
her	1
resistance;	1
only	1
once	1
had	1
he	1
a	1
gleam	1
of	1
light.	1
It	1
was	1
at	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
assembly	1
dances,	1
which	1
afford	1
the	1
only	1
outlet	1
to	1
the	1
passions	1
of	1
the	1
population	1
of	1
seaside	1
watering-places.	1
He	1
was	1
sitting	1
with	1
her	1
in	1
an	1
embrasure,	1
his	1
senses	1
tingling	1
with	1
the	1
contact	1
of	1
the	1
waltz.	1
She	1
had	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
over	1
her,	1
slowly	1
waving	1
fan;	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
lost	1
his	1
head.	1
Seizing	1
that	1
moving	1
wrist,	1
he	1
pressed	1
his	1
lips	1
to	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
her	1
arm.	1
And	1
she	1
had	1
shuddered	1
—	1
to	1
this	1
day	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
forgotten	1
that	1
shudder	1
—	1
nor	1
the	1
look	1
so	1
passionately	1
averse	1
she	1
had	1
given	1
him.	1
A	1
year	1
after	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
yielded.	1
What	1
had	1
made	1
her	1
yield	1
he	1
could	1
never	1
make	1
out;	1
and	1
from	1
Mrs.	1
Heron,	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
some	1
diplomatic	1
talent,	1
he	1
learnt	1
nothing.	1
Once	1
after	1
they	1
were	1
married	1
he	1
asked	1
her,	1
“What	1
made	1
you	1
refuse	1
me	1
so	1
often?”	1
She	1
had	1
answered	1
by	1
a	1
strange	1
silence.	1
An	1
enigma	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
he	1
first	1
saw	1
her,	1
she	1
was	1
an	1
enigma	1
to	1
him	1
still.	1
.	3
Bosinney	1
was	1
waiting	1
for	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
door;	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
rugged,	1
good-looking,	1
face	1
was	1
a	1
queer,	1
yearning,	1
yet	1
happy	1
look,	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
too	1
saw	1
a	1
promise	1
of	1
bliss	1
in	1
the	1
spring	1
sky,	1
sniffed	1
a	1
coming	1
happiness	1
in	1
the	1
spring	1
air.	1
Soames	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
waiting	1
there.	1
What	1
was	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
the	1
fellow	1
that	1
he	1
looked	1
so	1
happy?	1
What	1
was	1
he	1
waiting	1
for	1
with	1
that	1
smile	1
on	1
his	1
lips	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
eyes?	1
Soames	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
that	1
for	1
which	1
Bosinney	1
was	1
waiting	1
as	1
he	1
stood	1
there	1
drinking	1
in	1
the	1
flower-scented	1
wind.	1
And	1
once	1
more	1
he	1
felt	1
baffled	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
this	1
man	1
whom	1
by	1
habit	1
he	1
despised.	1
He	1
hastened	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
house.	1
“The	1
only	1
colour	1
for	1
those	1
tiles,”	1
he	1
heard	1
Bosinney	1
say	1
—	1
“is	1
ruby	1
with	1
a	1
grey	1
tint	1
in	1
the	1
stuff,	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
transparent	1
effect.	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
Irene’s	1
opinion.	1
I’m	1
ordering	1
the	1
purple	1
leather	1
curtains	1
for	1
the	1
doorway	1
of	1
this	1
court;	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
distemper	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
ivory	1
cream	1
over	1
paper,	1
you’ll	1
get	1
an	1
illusive	1
look.	1
You	1
want	1
to	1
aim	1
all	1
through	1
the	1
decorations	1
at	1
what	1
I	1
call	1
charm.”	1
Soames	1
said:	1
“You	1
mean	1
that	1
my	1
wife	1
has	1
charm!”	1
Bosinney	1
evaded	1
the	1
question.	1
“You	1
should	1
have	1
a	1
clump	1
of	1
iris	1
plants	1
in	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
that	1
court.”	1
Soames	1
smiled	1
superciliously.	1
“I’ll	1
look	1
into	1
Beech’s	1
some	1
time,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“and	1
see	1
what’s	1
appropriate!”	1
They	1
found	1
little	1
else	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
each	1
other,	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
Station	1
Soames	1
asked:	1
“I	1
suppose	1
you	1
find	1
Irene	1
very	1
artistic.”	1
“Yes.”	1
The	1
abrupt	1
answer	1
was	1
as	1
distinct	1
a	1
snub	1
as	1
saying:	1
“If	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
discuss	1
her	1
you	1
can	1
do	1
it	1
with	1
someone	1
else!”	1
And	1
the	1
slow,	1
sulky	1
anger	1
Soames	1
had	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
afternoon	1
burned	1
the	1
brighter	1
within	1
him.	1
Neither	1
spoke	1
again	1
till	1
they	1
were	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
Station,	1
then	1
Soames	1
asked:	1
“When	1
do	1
you	1
expect	1
to	1
have	1
finished?”	1
“By	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
June,	1
if	1
you	1
really	1
wish	1
me	1
to	1
decorate	1
as	1
well.”	1
Soames	1
nodded.	1
“But	1
you	1
quite	1
understand,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“that	1
the	1
house	1
is	1
costing	1
me	1
a	1
lot	1
beyond	1
what	1
I	1
contemplated.	1
I	1
may	1
as	1
well	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
thrown	1
it	1
up,	1
only	1
I’m	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
giving	1
up	1
what	1
I’ve	1
set	1
my	1
mind	1
on.”	1
Bosinney	1
made	1
no	1
reply.	1
And	1
Soames	1
gave	1
him	1
askance	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
dogged	1
dislike	1
—	1
for	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
fastidious	1
air	1
and	1
that	1
supercilious,	1
dandified	1
taciturnity,	1
Soames,	1
with	1
his	1
set	1
lips	1
and	1
squared	1
chin,	1
was	1
not	1
unlike	1
a	1
bulldog.	1
.	3
When,	1
at	1
seven	1
o’clock	1
that	1
evening,	1
June	1
arrived	1
at	1
62,	1
Montpellier	1
Square,	1
the	1
maid	1
Bilson	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Bosinney	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
drawing-room;	1
the	1
mistress	1
—	1
she	1
said	1
—	1
was	1
dressing,	1
and	1
would	1
be	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
minute.	1
She	1
would	1
tell	1
her	1
that	1
Miss	1
June	1
was	1
here.	1
June	1
stopped	1
her	1
at	1
once.	1
“All	1
right,	1
Bilson,”	1
she	1
said,	1
“I’ll	1
just	1
go	1
in.	1
You,	1
needn’t	1
hurry	1
Mrs.	1
Soames.”	1
She	1
took	1
off	1
her	1
cloak,	1
and	1
Bilson,	1
with	1
an	1
understanding	1
look,	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
open	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
door	1
for	1
her,	1
but	1
ran	1
downstairs.	1
June	1
paused	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
herself	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
old-fashioned	1
silver	1
mirror	1
above	1
the	1
oaken	1
rug	1
chest	1
—	1
a	1
slim,	1
imperious	1
young	1
figure,	1
with	1
a	1
small	1
resolute	1
face,	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
frock,	1
cut	1
moon-shaped	1
at	1
the	1
base	1
of	1
a	1
neck	1
too	1
slender	1
for	1
her	1
crown	1
of	1
twisted	1
red-gold	1
hair.	1
She	1
opened	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
door	1
softly,	1
meaning	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
by	1
surprise.	1
The	1
room	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
a	1
sweet	1
hot	1
scent	1
of	1
flowering	1
azaleas.	1
She	1
took	1
a	1
long	1
breath	1
of	1
the	1
perfume,	1
and	1
heard	1
Bosinney’s	1
voice,	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
room,	1
but	1
quite	1
close,	1
saying.	1
“Ah!	1
there	1
were	1
such	1
heaps	1
of	1
things	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
talk	1
about,	1
and	1
now	1
we	1
shan’t	1
have	1
time!”	1
Irene’s	1
voice	1
answered:	1
“Why	1
not	1
at	1
dinner?”	1
“How	1
can	1
one	1
talk.	1
.	3
”	1
June’s	1
first	1
thought	1
was	1
to	1
go	1
away,	1
but	1
instead	1
she	1
crossed	1
to	1
the	1
long	1
window	1
opening	1
on	1
the	1
little	1
court.	1
It	1
was	1
from	1
there	1
that	1
the	1
scent	1
of	1
the	1
azaleas	1
came,	1
and,	1
standing	1
with	1
their	1
backs	1
to	1
her,	1
their	1
faces	1
buried	1
in	1
the	1
golden-pink	1
blossoms,	1
stood	1
her	1
lover	1
and	1
Irene.	1
Silent	1
but	1
unashamed,	1
with	1
flaming	1
cheeks	1
and	1
angry	1
eyes,	1
the	1
girl	1
watched.	1
“Come	1
on	1
Sunday	1
by	1
yourself	1
—	1
We	1
can	1
go	1
over	1
the	1
house	1
together.”	1
June	1
saw	1
Irene	1
look	1
up	1
at	1
him	1
through	1
her	1
screen	1
of	1
blossoms.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
a	1
coquette,	1
but	1
—	1
far	1
worse	1
to	1
the	1
watching	1
girl	1
—	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
fearful	1
lest	1
that	1
look	1
should	1
say	1
too	1
much.	1
“I’ve	1
promised	1
to	1
go	1
for	1
a	1
drive	1
with	1
Uncle.	1
.	3
”	1
“The	1
big	1
one!	1
Make	1
him	1
bring	1
you;	1
it’s	1
only	1
ten	1
miles	1
—	1
the	1
very	1
thing	1
for	1
his	1
horses.”	1
“Poor	1
old	1
Uncle	1
Swithin!”	1
A	1
wave	1
of	1
the	1
azalea	1
scent	1
drifted	1
into	1
June’s	1
face;	1
she	1
felt	1
sick	1
and	1
dizzy.	1
“Do!	1
ah!	1
do!”	1
“But	1
why?”	1
“I	1
must	1
see	1
you	1
there	1
—	1
I	1
thought	1
you’d	1
like	1
to	1
help	1
me.	1
.	3
”	1
The	1
answer	1
seemed	1
to	1
the	1
girl	1
to	1
come	1
softly	1
with	1
a	1
tremble	1
from	1
amongst	1
the	1
blossoms:	1
“So	1
I	1
do!”	1
And	1
she	1
stepped	1
into	1
the	1
open	1
space	1
of	1
the	1
window.	1
“How	1
stuffy	1
it	1
is	1
here!”	1
she	1
said;	1
“I	1
can’t	1
bear	1
this	1
scent!”	1
Her	1
eyes,	1
so	1
angry	1
and	1
direct,	1
swept	1
both	1
their	1
faces.	1
“Were	1
you	1
talking	1
about	1
the	1
house?	1
I	1
haven’t	1
seen	1
it	1
yet,	1
you	1
know	1
—	1
shall	1
we	1
all	1
go	1
on	1
Sunday?”’	1
From	1
Irene’s	1
face	1
the	1
colour	1
had	1
flown.	1
“I	1
am	1
going	1
for	1
a	1
drive	1
that	1
day	1
with	1
Uncle	1
Swithin,”	1
she	1
answered.	1
“Uncle	1
Swithin!	1
What	1
does	1
he	1
matter?	1
You	1
can	1
throw	1
him	1
over!”	1
“I	1
am	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
throwing	1
people	1
over!”	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
sound	1
of	1
footsteps	1
and	1
June	1
saw	1
Soames	1
standing	1
just	1
behind	1
her.	1
“Well!	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
all	1
ready,”	1
said	1
Irene,	1
looking	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
with	1
a	1
strange	1
smile,	1
“dinner	1
is	1
too!”	1
Chapter	1
11	1
June’s	1
Treat	1
Dinner	1
began	1
in	1
silence;	1
the	1
women	1
facing	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
the	1
men.	1
In	1
silence	1
the	1
soup	1
was	1
finished	1
—	1
excellent,	1
if	1
a	1
little	1
thick;	1
and	1
fish	1
was	1
brought.	1
In	1
silence	1
it	1
was	1
handed.	1
Bosinney	1
ventured:	1
“It’s	1
the	1
first	1
spring	1
day.”	1
Irene	1
echoed	1
softly:	1
“Yes	1
—	1
the	1
first	1
spring	1
day.”	1
“Spring!”	1
said	1
June:	1
“there	1
isn’t	1
a	1
breath	1
of	1
air!”	1
No	1
one	1
replied.	1
The	1
fish	1
was	1
taken	1
away,	1
a	1
fine	1
fresh	1
sole	1
from	1
Dover.	1
And	1
Bilson	1
brought	1
champagne,	1
a	1
bottle	1
swathed	1
around	1
the	1
neck	1
with	1
white.	1
.	3
Soames	1
said:	1
“You’ll	1
find	1
it	1
dry.”	1
Cutlets	1
were	1
handed,	1
each	1
pink-frilled	1
about	1
the	1
legs.	1
They	1
were	1
refused	1
by	1
June,	1
and	1
silence	1
fell.	1
Soames	1
said:	1
“You’d	1
better	1
take	1
a	1
cutlet,	1
June;	1
there’s	1
nothing	1
coming.”	1
But	1
June	1
again	1
refused,	1
so	1
they	1
were	1
borne	1
away.	1
And	1
then	1
Irene	1
asked:	1
“Phil,	1
have	1
you	1
heard	1
my	1
blackbird?”	1
Bosinney	1
answered:	1
“Rather	1
—	1
he’s	1
got	1
a	1
hunting-song.	1
As	1
I	1
came	1
round	1
I	1
heard	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
Square.”	1
“He’s	1
such	1
a	1
darling!”	1
“Salad,	1
sir?”	1
Spring	1
chicken	1
was	1
removed.	1
But	1
Soames	1
was	1
speaking:	1
“The	1
asparagus	1
is	1
very	1
poor.	1
Bosinney,	1
glass	1
of	1
sherry	1
with	1
your	1
sweet?	1
June,	1
you’re	1
drinking	1
nothing!”	1
June	1
said:	1
“You	1
know	1
I	1
never	1
do.	1
Wine’s	1
such	1
horrid	1
stuff!”	1
An	1
apple	1
charlotte	1
came	1
upon	1
a	1
silver	1
dish,	1
and	1
smilingly	1
Irene	1
said:	1
“The	1
azaleas	1
are	1
so	1
wonderful	1
this	1
year!”	1
To	1
this	1
Bosinney	1
murmured:	1
“Wonderful!	1
The	1
scent’s	1
extraordinary!”	1
June	1
said:	1
“How	1
can	1
you	1
like	1
the	1
scent?	1
Sugar,	1
please,	1
Bilson.”	1
Sugar	1
was	1
handed	1
her,	1
and	1
Soames	1
remarked:	1
“This	1
charlottes	1
good!”	1
The	1
charlotte	1
was	1
removed.	1
Long	1
silence	1
followed.	1
Irene,	1
beckoning,	1
said:	1
“Take	1
out	1
the	1
azalea,	1
Bilson.	1
Miss	1
June	1
can’t	1
bear	1
the	1
scent.”	1
“No;	1
let	1
it	1
stay,”	1
said	1
June.	1
Olives	1
from	1
France,	1
with	1
Russian	1
caviare,	1
were	1
placed	1
on	1
little	1
plates.	1
And	1
Soames	1
remarked:	1
“Why	1
can’t	1
we	1
have	1
the	1
Spanish?”	1
But	1
no	1
one	1
answered.	1
The	1
olives	1
were	1
removed.	1
Lifting	1
her	1
tumbler	1
June	1
demanded:	1
“Give	1
me	1
some	1
water,	1
please.”	1
Water	1
was	1
given	1
her.	1
A	1
silver	1
tray	1
was	1
brought,	1
with	1
German	1
plums.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
lengthy	1
pause.	1
In	1
perfect	1
harmony	1
all	1
were	1
eating	1
them.	1
Bosinney	1
counted	1
up	1
the	1
stones:	1
“This	1
year	1
—	1
next	1
year	1
—	1
some	1
time.”	1
Irene	1
finished	1
softly:	1
“Never!	1
There	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
glorious	1
sunset.	1
The	1
sky’s	1
all	1
ruby	1
still	1
—	1
so	1
beautiful!”	1
He	1
answered:	1
“Underneath	1
the	1
dark.”	1
Their	1
eyes	1
had	1
met,	1
and	1
June	1
cried	1
scornfully:	1
“A	1
London	1
sunset!”	1
Egyptian	1
cigarettes	1
were	1
handed	1
in	1
a	1
silver	1
box.	1
Soames,	1
taking	1
one,	1
remarked:	1
“What	1
time’s	1
your	1
play	1
begin?”	1
No	1
one	1
replied,	1
and	1
Turkish	1
coffee	1
followed	1
in	1
enamelled	1
cups.	1
Irene,	1
smiling	1
quietly,	1
said:	1
“If	1
only.	1
.	3
”	1
“Only	1
what?”	1
said	1
June.	1
“If	1
only	1
it	1
could	1
always	1
be	1
the	1
spring!”	1
Brandy	1
was	1
handed;	1
it	1
was	1
pale	1
and	1
old.	1
Soames	1
said:	1
“Bosinney,	1
better	1
take	1
some	1
brandy.”	1
Bosinney	1
took	1
a	1
glass;	1
they	1
all	1
arose.	1
“You	1
want	1
a	1
cab?”	1
asked	1
Soames.	1
June	1
answered:	1
“No!	1
My	1
cloaks	1
please,	1
Bilson.”	1
Her	1
cloak	1
was	1
brought.	1
Irene,	1
from	1
the	1
window,	1
murmured:	1
“Such	1
a	1
lovely	1
night!	1
The	1
stars	1
are	1
coming	1
out!”	1
Soames	1
added:	1
“Well,	1
I	1
hope	1
you’ll	1
both	1
enjoy	1
yourselves.”	1
From	1
the	1
door	1
June	1
answered:	1
“Thanks.	1
Come,	1
Phil.”	1
Bosinney	1
cried:	1
“I’m	1
coming.”	1
Soames	1
smiled	1
a	1
sneering	1
smile,	1
and	1
said:	1
“I	1
wish	1
you	1
luck!”	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
Irene	1
watched	1
them	1
go.	1
Bosinney	1
called:	1
“Good	1
night!”	1
“Good	1
night!”	1
she	1
answered	1
softly.	1
.	3
June	1
made	1
her	1
lover	1
take	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
a	1
‘bus,	1
saying	1
she	1
wanted	1
air,	1
and	1
there	1
sat	1
silent,	1
with	1
her	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
breeze.	1
The	1
driver	1
turned	1
once	1
or	1
twice,	1
with	1
the	1
intention	1
of	1
venturing	1
a	1
remark,	1
but	1
thought	1
better	1
of	1
it.	1
They	1
were	1
a	1
lively	1
couple!	1
The	1
spring	1
had	1
got	1
into	1
his	1
blood,	1
too;	1
he	1
felt	1
the	1
need	1
for	1
letting	1
steam	1
escape,	1
and	1
clucked	1
his	1
tongue,	1
flourishing	1
his	1
whip,	1
wheeling	1
his	1
horses,	1
and	1
even	1
they,	1
poor	1
things,	1
had	1
smelled	1
the	1
spring,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
brief	1
half-hour	1
spurned	1
the	1
pavement	1
with	1
happy	1
hoofs.	1
The	1
whole	1
town	1
was	1
alive;	1
the	1
boughs,	1
curled	1
upward	1
with	1
their	1
decking	1
of	1
young	1
leaves,	1
awaited	1
some	1
gift	1
the	1
breeze	1
could	1
bring.	1
New-lighted	1
lamps	1
were	1
gaining	1
mastery,	1
and	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
showed	1
pale	1
under	1
that	1
glare,	1
while	1
on	1
high	1
the	1
great	1
white	1
clouds	1
slid	1
swiftly,	1
softly,	1
over	1
the	1
purple	1
sky.	1
Men	1
in,	1
evening	1
dress	1
had	1
thrown	1
back	1
overcoats,	1
stepping	1
jauntily	1
up	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
Clubs;	1
working	1
folk	1
loitered;	1
and	1
women	1
—	1
those	1
women	1
who	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
of	1
night	1
are	1
solitary	1
—	1
solitary	1
and	1
moving	1
eastward	1
in	1
a	1
stream	1
—	1
swung	1
slowly	1
along,	1
with	1
expectation	1
in	1
their	1
gait,	1
dreaming	1
of	1
good	1
wine	1
and	1
a	1
good	1
supper,	1
or	1
—	1
for	1
an	1
unwonted	1
minute,	1
of	1
kisses	1
given	1
for	1
love.	1
Those	1
countless	1
figures,	1
going	1
their	1
ways	1
under	1
the	1
lamps	1
and	1
the	1
moving-sky,	1
had	1
one	1
and	1
all	1
received	1
some	1
restless	1
blessing	1
from	1
the	1
stir	1
of	1
spring.	1
And	1
one	1
and	1
all,	1
like	1
those	1
clubmen	1
with	1
their	1
opened	1
coats,	1
had	1
shed	1
something	1
of	1
caste,	1
and	1
creed,	1
and	1
custom,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
cock	1
of	1
their	1
hats,	1
the	1
pace	1
of	1
their	1
walk,	1
their	1
laughter,	1
or	1
their	1
silence,	1
revealed	1
their	1
common	1
kinship	1
under	1
the	1
passionate	1
heavens.	1
Bosinney	1
and	1
June	1
entered	1
the	1
theatre	1
in	1
silence,	1
and	1
mounted	1
to	1
their	1
seats	1
in	1
the	1
upper	1
boxes.	1
The	1
piece	1
had	1
just	1
begun,	1
and	1
the	1
half-darkened	1
house,	1
with	1
its	1
rows	1
of	1
creatures	1
peering	1
all	1
one	1
way,	1
resembled	1
a	1
great	1
garden	1
of	1
flowers	1
turning	1
their	1
faces	1
to	1
the	1
sun.	1
June	1
had	1
never	1
before	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
upper	1
boxes.	1
From	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
fifteen	1
she	1
had	1
habitually	1
accompanied	1
her	1
grandfather	1
to	1
the	1
stalls,	1
and	1
not	1
common	1
stalls,	1
but	1
the	1
best	1
seats	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
towards	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
row,	1
booked	1
by	1
old	1
Jolyon,	1
at	1
Grogan	1
and	1
Boyne’s,	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
home	1
from	1
the	1
City,	1
long	1
before	1
the	1
day;	1
carried	1
in	1
his	1
overcoat	1
pocket,	1
together	1
with	1
his	1
cigar-case	1
and	1
his	1
old	1
kid	1
gloves,	1
and	1
handed	1
to	1
June	1
to	1
keep	1
till	1
the	1
appointed	1
night.	1
And	1
in	1
those	1
stalls	1
—	1
an	1
erect	1
old	1
figure	1
with	1
a	1
serene	1
white	1
head,	1
a	1
little	1
figure,	1
strenuous	1
and	1
eager,	1
with	1
a	1
red-gold	1
head	1
—	1
they	1
would	1
sit	1
through	1
every	1
kind	1
of	1
play,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
home	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
would	1
say	1
of	1
the	1
principal	1
actor:	1
“Oh,	1
he’s	1
a	1
poor	1
stick!	1
You	1
should	1
have	1
seen	1
little	1
Bobson!”	1
She	1
had	1
looked	1
forward	1
to	1
this	1
evening	1
with	1
keen	1
delight;	1
it	1
was	1
stolen,	1
chaperone-less,	1
undreamed	1
of	1
at	1
Stanhope	1
Gate,	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
supposed	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
Soames’.	1
She	1
had	1
expected	1
reward	1
for	1
her	1
subterfuge,	1
planned	1
for	1
her	1
lover’s	1
sake;	1
she	1
had	1
expected	1
it	1
to	1
break	1
up	1
the	1
thick,	1
chilly	1
cloud,	1
and	1
make	1
the	1
relations	1
between	1
them	1
which	1
of	1
late	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
puzzling,	1
so	1
tormenting	1
—	1
sunny	1
and	1
simple	1
again	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
before	1
the	1
winter.	1
She	1
had	1
come	1
with	1
the	1
intention	1
of	1
saying	1
something	1
definite;	1
and	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
stage	1
with	1
a	1
furrow	1
between	1
her	1
brows,	1
seeing	1
nothing,	1
her	1
hands	1
squeezed	1
together	1
in	1
her	1
lap.	1
A	1
swarm	1
of	1
jealous	1
suspicions	1
stung	1
and	1
stung	1
her.	1
If	1
Bosinney	1
was	1
conscious	1
of	1
her	1
trouble	1
he	1
made	1
no	1
sign.	1
The	1
curtain	1
dropped.	1
The	1
first	1
act	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
an	1
end.	1
“It’s	1
awfully	1
hot	1
here!”	1
said	1
the	1
girl;	1
“I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
go	1
out.”	1
She	1
was	1
very	1
white,	1
and	1
she	1
knew	1
—	1
for	1
with	1
her	1
nerves	1
thus	1
sharpened	1
she	1
saw	1
everything	1
—	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
both	1
uneasy	1
and	1
compunctious.	1
At	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
theatre	1
an	1
open	1
balcony	1
hung	1
over	1
the	1
street;	1
she	1
took	1
possession	1
of	1
this,	1
and	1
stood	1
leaning	1
there	1
without	1
a	1
word,	1
waiting	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
begin.	1
At	1
last	1
she	1
could	1
bear	1
it	1
no	1
longer.	1
“I	1
want	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
to	1
you,	1
Phil,”	1
she	1
said.	1
“Yes?”	1
The	1
defensive	1
tone	1
of	1
his	1
voice	1
brought	1
the	1
colour	1
flying	1
to	1
her	1
cheek,	1
the	1
words	1
flying	1
to	1
her	1
lips:	1
“You	1
don’t	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
chance	1
to	1
be	1
nice	1
to	1
you;	1
you	1
haven’t	1
for	1
ages	1
now!”	1
Bosinney	1
stared	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
street.	1
He	1
made	1
no	1
answer.	1
.	3
June	1
cried	1
passionately:	1
“You	1
know	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
do	1
everything	1
for	1
you	1
—	1
that	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
everything	1
to	1
you.	1
.	3
”	1
A	1
hum	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
street,	1
and,	1
piercing	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
sharp	1
‘ping,’	1
the	1
bell	1
sounded	1
for	1
the	1
raising	1
of	1
the	1
curtain.	1
June	1
did	1
not	1
stir.	1
A	1
desperate	1
struggle	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
within	1
her.	1
Should	1
she	1
put	1
everything	1
to	1
the	1
proof?	1
Should	1
she	1
challenge	1
directly	1
that	1
influence,	1
that	1
attraction	1
which	1
was	1
driving	1
him	1
away	1
from	1
her?	1
It	1
was	1
her	1
nature	1
to	1
challenge,	1
and	1
she	1
said:	1
“Phil,	1
take	1
me	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
house	1
on	1
Sunday!”	1
With	1
a	1
smile	1
quivering	1
and	1
breaking	1
on	1
her	1
lips,	1
and	1
trying,	1
how	1
hard,	1
not	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
watching,	1
she	1
searched	1
his	1
face,	1
saw	1
it	1
waver	1
and	1
hesitate,	1
saw	1
a	1
troubled	1
line	1
come	1
between	1
his	1
brows,	1
the	1
blood	1
rush	1
into	1
his	1
face.	1
He	1
answered:	1
“Not	1
Sunday,	1
dear;	1
some	1
other	1
day!”	1
“Why	1
not	1
Sunday?	1
I	1
shouldn’t	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
on	1
Sunday.”	1
He	1
made	1
an	1
evident	1
effort,	1
and	1
said:	1
“I	1
have	1
an	1
engagement.”	1
“You	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
take.	1
.	3
”	1
His	1
eyes	1
grew	1
angry;	1
he	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
and	1
answered:	1
“An	1
engagement	1
that	1
will	1
prevent	1
my	1
taking	1
you	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
house!”	1
June	1
bit	1
her	1
lip	1
till	1
the	1
blood	1
came,	1
and	1
walked	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
seat	1
without	1
another	1
word,	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
the	1
tears	1
of	1
rage	1
rolling	1
down	1
her	1
face.	1
The	1
house	1
had	1
been	1
mercifully	1
darkened	1
for	1
a	1
crisis,	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
see	1
her	1
trouble.	1
Yet	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
of	1
Forsytes	1
let	1
no	1
man	1
think	1
himself	1
immune	1
from	1
observation.	1
In	1
the	1
third	1
row	1
behind,	1
Euphemia,	1
Nicholas’s	1
youngest	1
daughter,	1
with	1
her	1
married-sister,	1
Mrs.	1
Tweetyman,	1
were	1
watching.	1
They	1
reported	1
at	1
Timothy’s,	1
how	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
June	1
and	1
her	1
fiance	1
at	1
the	1
theatre.	1
“In	1
the	1
stalls?”	1
“No,	1
not	1
in	1
the.	1
.	3
”	1
“Oh!	1
in	1
the	1
dress	1
circle,	1
of	1
course.	1
That	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
quite	1
fashionable	1
nowadays	1
with	1
young	1
people!”	1
Well	1
—	1
not	1
exactly.	1
In	1
the.	1
.	3
Anyway,	1
that	1
engagement	1
wouldn’t	1
last	1
long.	1
They	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
anyone	1
look	1
so	1
thunder	1
and	1
lightningy	1
as	1
that	1
little	1
June!	1
With	1
tears	1
of	1
enjoyment	1
in	1
their	1
eyes,	1
they	1
related	1
how	1
she	1
had	1
kicked	1
a	1
man’s	1
hat	1
as	1
she	1
returned	1
to	1
her	1
seat	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
an	1
act,	1
and	1
how	1
the	1
man	1
had	1
looked.	1
Euphemia	1
had	1
a	1
noted,	1
silent	1
laugh,	1
terminating	1
most	1
disappointingly	1
in	1
squeaks;	1
and	1
when	1
Mrs.	1
Small,	1
holding	1
up	1
her	1
hands,	1
said:	1
“My	1
dear!	1
Kicked	1
a	1
ha-at?”	1
she	1
let	1
out	1
such	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
these	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
recovered	1
with	1
smelling-salts.	1
As	1
she	1
went	1
away	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Tweetyman:	1
“Kicked	1
a	1
—	1
ha-at!	1
Oh!	1
I	1
shall	1
die.”	1
For	1
‘that	1
little	1
June’	1
this	1
evening,	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
‘her	1
treat,’	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
miserable	1
she	1
had	1
ever	1
spent.	1
God	1
knows	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
stifle	1
her	1
pride,	1
her	1
suspicion,	1
her	1
jealousy!	1
She	1
parted	1
from	1
Bosinney	1
at	1
old	1
Jolyon’s	1
door	1
without	1
breaking	1
down;	1
the	1
feeling	1
that	1
her	1
lover	1
must	1
be	1
conquered	1
was	1
strong	1
enough	1
to	1
sustain	1
her	1
till	1
his	1
retiring	1
footsteps	1
brought	1
home	1
the	1
true	1
extent	1
of	1
her	1
wretchedness.	1
The	1
noiseless	1
‘Sankey’	1
let	1
her	1
in.	1
She	1
would	1
have	1
slipped	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
room,	1
but	1
old	1
Jolyon,	1
who	1
had	1
heard	1
her	1
entrance,	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
dining-room	1
doorway.	1
“Come	1
in	1
and	1
have	1
your	1
milk,”	1
he	1
said.	1
“It’s	1
been	1
kept	1
hot	1
for	1
you.	1
You’re	1
very	1
late.	1
Where	1
have	1
you	1
been?”	1
June	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
fireplace,	1
with	1
a	1
foot	1
on	1
the	1
fender	1
and	1
an	1
arm	1
on	1
the	1
mantelpiece,	1
as	1
her	1
grandfather	1
had	1
done	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
in	1
that	1
night	1
of	1
the	1
opera.	1
She	1
was	1
too	1
near	1
a	1
breakdown	1
to	1
care	1
what	1
she	1
told	1
him.	1
“We	1
dined	1
at	1
Soames’s.”	1
“H’m!	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
property!	1
His	1
wife	1
there	1
and	1
Bosinney?”	1
“Yes.”	1
Old	1
Jolyon’s	1
glance	1
was	1
fixed	1
on	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
penetrating	1
gaze	1
from	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
difficult	1
to	1
hide;	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
looking	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
turned	1
her	1
face,	1
he	1
dropped	1
his	1
scrutiny	1
at	1
once.	1
He	1
had	1
seen	1
enough,	1
and	1
too	1
much.	1
He	1
bent	1
down	1
to	1
lift	1
the	1
cup	1
of	1
milk	1
for	1
her	1
from	1
the	1
hearth,	1
and,	1
turning	1
away,	1
grumbled:	1
“You	1
oughtn’t	1
to	1
stay	1
out	1
so	1
late;	1
it	1
makes	1
you	1
fit	1
for	1
nothing.”	1
He	1
was	1
invisible	1
now	1
behind	1
his	1
paper,	1
which	1
he	1
turned	1
with	1
a	1
vicious	1
crackle;	1
but	1
when	1
June	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
kiss	1
him,	1
he	1
said:	1
“Good-night,	1
my	1
darling,”	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
so	1
tremulous	1
and	1
unexpected,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
girl	1
could	1
do	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
without	1
breaking	1
into	1
the	1
fit	1
of	1
sobbing	1
which	1
lasted	1
her	1
well	1
on	1
into	1
the	1
night.	1
When	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
closed,	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
dropped	1
his	1
paper,	1
and	1
stared	1
long	1
and	1
anxiously	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him.	1
‘The	1
beggar!’	1
he	1
thought.	1
‘I	1
always	1
knew	1
she’d	1
have	1
trouble	1
with	1
him!’	1
Uneasy	1
doubts	1
and	1
suspicions,	1
the	1
more	1
poignant	1
that	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
powerless	1
to	1
check	1
or	1
control	1
the	1
march	1
of	1
events,	1
came	1
crowding	1
upon	1
him.	1
Was	1
the	1
fellow	1
going	1
to	1
jilt	1
her?	1
He	1
longed	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
say	1
to	1
him:	1
“Look	1
here,	1
you	1
sir!	1
Are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
jilt	1
my	1
grand-daughter?”	1
But	1
how	1
could	1
he?	1
Knowing	1
little	1
or	1
nothing,	1
he	1
was	1
yet	1
certain,	1
with	1
his	1
unerring	1
astuteness,	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
going	1
on.	1
He	1
suspected	1
Bosinney	1
of	1
being	1
too	1
much	1
at	1
Montpellier	1
Square.	1
‘This	1
fellow,’	1
he	1
thought,	1
‘may	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
scamp;	1
his	1
face	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
bad	1
one,	1
but	1
he’s	1
a	1
queer	1
fish.	1
I	1
don’t	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
make	1
of	1
him.	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
make	1
of	1
him!	1
They	1
tell	1
me	1
he	1
works	1
like	1
a	1
nigger,	1
but	1
I	1
see	1
no	1
good	1
coming	1
of	1
it.	1
He’s	1
unpractical,	1
he	1
has	1
no	1
method.	1
When	1
he	1
comes	1
here,	1
he	1
sits	1
as	1
glum	1
as	1
a	1
monkey.	1
If	1
I	1
ask	1
him	1
what	1
wine	1
he’ll	1
have,	1
he	1
says:	1
“Thanks,	1
any	1
wine.”	1
If	1
I	1
offer	1
him	1
a	1
cigar,	1
he	1
smokes	1
it	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
twopenny	1
German	1
thing.	1
I	1
never	1
see	1
him	1
looking	1
at	1
June	1
as	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
her;	1
and	1
yet,	1
he’s	1
not	1
after	1
her	1
money.	1
If	1
she	1
were	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
sign,	1
he’d	1
be	1
off	1
his	1
bargain	1
to-morrow.	1
But	1
she	1
won’t	1
—	1
not	1
she!	1
She’ll	1
stick	1
to	1
him!	1
She’s	1
as	1
obstinate	1
as	1
fate	1
—	1
She’ll	1
never	1
let	1
go!’	1
Sighing	1
deeply,	1
he	1
turned	1
the	1
paper;	1
in	1
its	1
columns,	1
perchance	1
he	1
might	1
find	1
consolation.	1
And	1
upstairs	1
in	1
her	1
room	1
June	1
sat	1
at	1
her	1
open	1
window,	1
where	1
the	1
spring	1
wind	1
came,	1
after	1
its	1
revel	1
across	1
the	1
Park,	1
to	1
cool	1
her	1
hot	1
cheeks	1
and	1
burn	1
her	1
heart.	1
Chapter	1
12	1
Drive	1
with	1
Swithin	1
Two	1
lines	1
of	1
a	1
certain	1
song	1
in	1
a	1
certain	1
famous	1
old	1
school’s	1
songbook	1
run	1
as	1
follows:	1
‘How	1
the	1
buttons	1
on	1
his	1
blue	1
frock	1
shone,	1
tra-la-la!	1
How	1
he	1
carolled	1
and	1
he	1
sang,	1
like	1
a	1
bird!.	1
.	3
’	1
Swithin	1
did	1
not	1
exactly	1
carol	1
and	1
sing	1
like	1
a	1
bird,	1
but	1
he	1
felt	1
almost	1
like	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
hum	1
a	1
tune,	1
as	1
he	1
stepped	1
out	1
of	1
Hyde	1
Park	1
Mansions,	1
and	1
contemplated	1
his	1
horses	1
drawn	1
up	1
before	1
the	1
door.	1
The	1
afternoon	1
was	1
as	1
balmy	1
as	1
a	1
day	1
in	1
June,	1
and	1
to	1
complete	1
the	1
simile	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
song,	1
he	1
had	1
put	1
on	1
a	1
blue	1
frock-coat,	1
dispensing	1
with	1
an	1
overcoat,	1
after	1
sending	1
Adolf	1
down	1
three	1
times	1
to	1
make	1
sure	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
least	1
suspicion	1
of	1
east	1
in	1
the	1
wind;	1
and	1
the	1
frock-coat	1
was	1
buttoned	1
so	1
tightly	1
around	1
his	1
personable	1
form,	1
that,	1
if	1
the	1
buttons	1
did	1
not	1
shine,	1
they	1
might	1
pardonably	1
have	1
done	1
so.	1
Majestic	1
on	1
the	1
pavement	1
he	1
fitted	1
on	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
dog-skin	1
gloves;	1
with	1
his	1
large	1
bell-shaped	1
top	1
hat,	1
and	1
his	1
great	1
stature	1
and	1
bulk	1
he	1
looked	1
too	1
primeval	1
for	1
a	1
Forsyte.	1
His	1
thick	1
white	1
hair,	1
on	1
which	1
Adolf	1
had	1
bestowed	1
a	1
touch	1
of	1
pomatum,	1
exhaled	1
the	1
fragrance	1
of	1
opoponax	1
and	1
cigars	1
—	1
the	1
celebrated	1
Swithin	1
brand,	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
paid	1
one	1
hundred	1
and	1
forty	1
shillings	1
the	1
hundred,	1
and	1
of	1
which	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
had	1
unkindly	1
said,	1
he	1
wouldn’t	1
smoke	1
them	1
as	1
a	1
gift;	1
they	1
wanted	1
the	1
stomach	1
of	1
a	1
horse!	1
“Adolf!”	1
“Sare!”	1
“The	1
new	1
plaid	1
rug!”	1
He	1
would	1
never	1
teach	1
that	1
fellow	1
to	1
look	1
smart;	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Soames	1
he	1
felt	1
sure,	1
had	1
an	1
eye!	1
“The	1
phaeton	1
hood	1
down;	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
—	1
to	1
—	1
drive	1
—	1
a	1
—	1
lady!”	1
A	1
pretty	1
woman	1
would	1
want	1
to	1
show	1
off	1
her	1
frock;	1
and	1
well	1
—	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
drive	1
a	1
lady!	1
It	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
new	1
beginning	1
to	1
the	1
good	1
old	1
days.	1
Ages	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
driven	1
a	1
woman!	1
The	1
last	1
time,	1
if	1
he	1
remembered,	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
Juley;	1
the	1
poor	1
old	1
soul	1
had	1
been	1
as	1
nervous	1
as	1
a	1
cat	1
the	1
whole	1
time,	1
and	1
so	1
put	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
patience	1
that,	1
as	1
he	1
dropped	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
Bayswater	1
Road,	1
he	1
had	1
said:	1
“Well	1
I’m	1
d	1
—-d	1
if	1
I	1
ever	1
drive	1
you	1
again!”	1
And	1
he	1
never	1
had,	1
not	1
he!	1
Going	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
horses’	1
heads,	1
he	1
examined	1
their	1
bits;	1
not	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
anything	1
about	1
bits	1
—	1
he	1
didn’t	1
pay	1
his	1
coachman	1
sixty	1
pounds	1
a	1
year	1
to	1
do	1
his	1
work	1
for	1
him,	1
that	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
his	1
principle.	1
Indeed,	1
his	1
reputation	1
as	1
a	1
horsey	1
man	1
rested	1
mainly	1
on	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
once,	1
on	1
Derby	1
Day,	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
welshed	1
by	1
some	1
thimble-riggers.	1
But	1
someone	1
at	1
the	1
Club,	1
after	1
seeing	1
him	1
drive	1
his	1
greys	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
—	1
he	1
always	1
drove	1
grey	1
horses,	1
you	1
got	1
more	1
style	1
for	1
the	1
money,	1
some	1
thought	1
—	1
had	1
called	1
him	1
‘Four-in-hand	1
Forsyte.’	1
The	1
name	1
having	1
reached	1
his	1
ears	1
through	1
that	1
fellow	1
Nicholas	1
Treffry,	1
old	1
Jolyon’s	1
dead	1
partner,	1
the	1
great	1
driving	1
man	1
notorious	1
for	1
more	1
carriage	1
accidents	1
than	1
any	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
—	1
Swithin	1
had	1
ever	1
after	1
conceived	1
it	1
right	1
to	1
act	1
up	1
to	1
it.	1
The	1
name	1
had	1
taken	1
his	1
fancy,	1
not	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
driven	1
four-in-hand,	1
or	1
was	1
ever	1
likely	1
to,	1
but	1
because	1
of	1
something	1
distinguished	1
in	1
the	1
sound.	1
Four-in-hand	1
Forsyte!	1
Not	1
bad!	1
Born	1
too	1
soon,	1
Swithin	1
had	1
missed	1
his	1
vocation.	1
Coming	1
upon	1
London	1
twenty	1
years	1
later,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
failed	1
to	1
have	1
become	1
a	1
stockbroker,	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
select,	1
this	1
great	1
profession	1
had	1
not	1
as	1
yet	1
became	1
the	1
chief	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
upper-middle	1
class.	1
He	1
had	1
literally	1
been	1
forced	1
into	1
land	1
agency.	1
Once	1
in	1
the	1
driving	1
seat,	1
with	1
the	1
reins	1
handed	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
blinking	1
over	1
his	1
pale	1
old	1
cheeks	1
in	1
the	1
full	1
sunlight,	1
he	1
took	1
a	1
slow	1
look	1
round	1
—	1
Adolf	1
was	1
already	1
up	1
behind;	1
the	1
cockaded	1
groom	1
at	1
the	1
horses’	1
heads	1
stood	1
ready	1
to	1
let	1
go;	1
everything	1
was	1
prepared	1
for	1
the	1
signal,	1
and	1
Swithin	1
gave	1
it.	1
The	1
equipage	1
dashed	1
forward,	1
and	1
before	1
you	1
could	1
say	1
Jack	1
Robinson,	1
with	1
a	1
rattle	1
and	1
flourish	1
drew	1
up	1
at	1
Soames’	1
door.	1
Irene	1
came	1
out	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
stepped	1
in	1
—	1
he	1
afterward	1
described	1
it	1
at	1
Timothy’s	1
—“as	1
light	1
as	1
—	1
er	1
—	1
Taglioni,	1
no	1
fuss	1
about	1
it,	1
no	1
wanting	1
this	1
or	1
wanting	1
that;”	1
and	1
above	1
all,	1
Swithin	1
dwelt	1
on	1
this,	1
staring	1
at	1
Mrs.	1
Septimus	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
disconcerted	1
her	1
a	1
good	1
deal,	1
“no	1
silly	1
nervousness!”	1
To	1
Aunt	1
Hester	1
he	1
portrayed	1
Irene’s	1
hat.	1
“Not	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
great	1
flopping	1
things,	1
sprawling	1
about,	1
and	1
catching	1
the	1
dust,	1
that	1
women	1
are	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
nowadays,	1
but	1
a	1
neat	1
little	1
—”	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
circular	1
motion	1
of	1
his	1
hand,	1
“white	1
veil	1
—	1
capital	1
taste.”	1
“What	1
was	1
it	1
made	1
of?”	1
inquired	1
Aunt	1
Hester,	1
who	1
manifested	1
a	1
languid	1
but	1
permanent	1
excitement	1
at	1
any	1
mention	1
of	1
dress.	1
“Made	1
of?”	1
returned	1
Swithin;	1
“now	1
how	1
should	1
I	1
know?”	1
He	1
sank	1
into	1
silence	1
so	1
profound	1
that	1
Aunt	1
Hester	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
afraid	1
he	1
had	1
fallen	1
into	1
a	1
trance.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
try	1
to	1
rouse	1
him	1
herself,	1
it	1
not	1
being	1
her	1
custom.	1
‘I	1
wish	1
somebody	1
would	1
come,’	1
she	1
thought;	1
‘I	1
don’t	1
like	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
him!’	1
But	1
suddenly	1
Swithin	1
returned	1
to	1
life.	1
“Made	1
of”	1
he	1
wheezed	1
out	1
slowly,	1
“what	1
should	1
it	1
be	1
made	1
of?”	1
They	1
had	1
not	1
gone	1
four	1
miles	1
before	1
Swithin	1
received	1
the	1
impression	1
that	1
Irene	1
liked	1
driving	1
with	1
him.	1
Her	1
face	1
was	1
so	1
soft	1
behind	1
that	1
white	1
veil,	1
and	1
her	1
dark	1
eyes	1
shone	1
so	1
in	1
the	1
spring	1
light,	1
and	1
whenever	1
he	1
spoke	1
she	1
raised	1
them	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
smiled.	1
On	1
Saturday	1
morning	1
Soames	1
had	1
found	1
her	1
at	1
her	1
writing-table	1
with	1
a	1
note	1
written	1
to	1
Swithin,	1
putting	1
him	1
off.	1
Why	1
did	1
she	1
want	1
to	1
put	1
him	1
off?	1
he	1
asked.	1
She	1
might	1
put	1
her	1
own	1
people	1
off	1
when	1
she	1
liked,	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
her	1
putting	1
off	1
his	1
people!	1
She	1
had	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
intently,	1
had	1
torn	1
up	1
the	1
note,	1
and	1
said:	1
“Very	1
well!”	1
And	1
then	1
she	1
began	1
writing	1
another.	1
He	1
took	1
a	1
casual	1
glance	1
presently,	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
addressed	1
to	1
Bosinney.	1
“What	1
are	1
you	1
writing	1
to	1
him	1
about?”	1
he	1
asked.	1
Irene,	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
again	1
with	1
that	1
intent	1
look,	1
said	1
quietly:	1
“Something	1
he	1
wanted	1
me	1
to	1
do	1
for	1
him!”	1
“Humph!”	1
said	1
Soames	1
—	1
“Commissions!”	1
“You’ll	1
have	1
your	1
work	1
cut	1
out	1
if	1
you	1
begin	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
thing!”	1
He	1
said	1
no	1
more.	1
Swithin	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes	1
at	1
the	1
mention	1
of	1
Robin	1
Hill;	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
way	1
for	1
his	1
horses,	1
and	1
he	1
always	1
dined	1
at	1
half-past	1
seven,	1
before	1
the	1
rush	1
at	1
the	1
Club	1
began;	1
the	1
new	1
chef	1
took	1
more	1
trouble	1
with	1
an	1
early	1
dinner	1
—	1
a	1
lazy	1
rascal!	1
He	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
house,	1
however.	1
A	1
house	1
appealed	1
to	1
any	1
Forsyte,	1
and	1
especially	1
to	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
an	1
auctioneer.	1
After	1
all	1
he	1
said	1
the	1
distance	1
was	1
nothing.	1
When	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
younger	1
man	1
he	1
had	2
rooms	1
at	1
Richmond	1
for	1
many	1
years,	1
kept	1
his	1
carriage	1
and	1
pair	1
there,	1
and	1
drove	1
them	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
to	1
business	1
every	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
life.	1
Four-in-hand	1
Forsyte	1
they	1
called	1
him!	1
His	1
T-cart,	1
his	1
horses	1
had	1
been	1
known	1
from	1
Hyde	1
Park	1
Corner	1
to	1
the	1
Star	1
and	1
Garter.	1
The	1
Duke	1
of	1
Z.	1
.	3
wanted	1
to	1
get	1
hold	1
of	1
them,	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
him	1
double	1
the	1
money,	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
kept	1
them;	1
know	1
a	1
good	1
thing	1
when	1
you	1
have	1
it,	1
eh?	1
A	1
look	1
of	1
solemn	1
pride	1
came	1
portentously	1
on	1
his	1
shaven	1
square	1
old	1
face,	1
he	1
rolled	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
his	1
stand-up	1
collar,	1
like	1
a	1
turkey-cock	1
preening	1
himself.	1
She	1
was	1
really	1
—	1
a	1
charming	1
woman!	1
He	1
enlarged	1
upon	1
her	1
frock	1
afterwards	1
to	1
Aunt	1
Juley,	1
who	1
held	1
up	1
her	1
hands	1
at	1
his	1
way	1
of	1
putting	1
it.	1
Fitted	1
her	1
like	1
a	1
skin	1
—	1
tight	1
as	1
a	1
drum;	1
that	1
was	1
how	1
he	1
liked	1
’em,	1
all	1
of	1
a	1
piece,	1
none	1
of	1
your	1
daverdy,	1
scarecrow	1
women!	1
He	1
gazed	1
at	1
Mrs.	1
Septimus	1
Small,	1
who	1
took	1
after	1
James	1
—	1
long	1
and	1
thin.	1
“There’s	1
style	1
about	1
her,”	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
“fit	1
for	1
a	1
king!	1
And	1
she’s	1
so	1
quiet	1
with	1
it	1
too!”	1
“She	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
made	1
quite	1
a	1
conquest	1
of	1
you,	1
any	1
way,”	1
drawled	1
Aunt	1
Hester	1
from	1
her	1
corner.	1
Swithin	1
heard	1
extremely	1
well	1
when	1
anybody	1
attacked	1
him.	1
“What’s	1
that?”	1
he	1
said.	1
“I	1
know	1
a	1
—	1
pretty	1
—	1
woman	1
when	1
I	1
see	1
one,	1
and	1
all	1
I	1
can	1
say	1
is,	1
I	1
don’t	1
see	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
about	1
that’s	1
fit	1
for	1
her;	1
but	1
perhaps	1
—	1
you	1
—	1
do,	1
come,	1
perhaps	1
—	1
you-do!”	1
“Oh?”	1
murmured	1
Aunt	1
Hester,	1
“ask	1
Juley!”	1
Long	1
before	1
they	1
reached	1
Robin	1
Hill,	1
however,	1
the	1
unaccustomed	1
airing	1
had	1
made	1
him	1
terribly	1
sleepy;	1
he	1
drove	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
closed,	1
a	1
life-time	1
of	1
deportment	1
alone	1
keeping	1
his	1
tall	1
and	1
bulky	1
form	1
from	1
falling	1
askew.	1
Bosinney,	1
who	1
was	1
watching,	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
them,	1
and	1
all	1
three	1
entered	1
the	1
house	1
together;	1
Swithin	1
in	1
front	1
making	1
play	1
with	1
a	1
stout	1
gold-mounted	1
Malacca	1
cane,	1
put	1
into	1
his	1
hand	1
by	1
Adolf,	1
for	1
his	1
knees	1
were	1
feeling	1
the	1
effects	1
of	1
their	1
long	1
stay	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
position.	1
He	1
had	1
assumed	1
his	1
fur	1
coat,	1
to	1
guard	1
against	1
the	1
draughts	1
of	1
the	1
unfinished	1
house.	1
The	1
staircase	1
—	1
he	1
said	1
—	1
was	1
handsome!	1
the	1
baronial	1
style!	1
They	1
would	1
want	1
some	1
statuary	1
about!	1
He	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
standstill	1
between	1
the	1
columns	1
of	1
the	1
doorway	1
into	1
the	1
inner	1
court,	1
and	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
cane	1
inquiringly.	1
What	1
was	1
this	1
to	1
be	1
—	1
this	1
vestibule,	1
or	1
whatever	1
they	1
called	1
it?	1
But	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
skylight,	1
inspiration	1
came	1
to	1
him.	1
“Ah!	1
the	1
billiard-room!”	1
When	1
told	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
tiled	1
court	1
with	1
plants	1
in	1
the	1
centre,	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
Irene:	1
“Waste	1
this	1
on	1
plants?	1
You	1
take	1
my	1
advice	1
and	1
have	1
a	1
billiard	1
table	1
here!”	1
Irene	1
smiled.	1
She	1
had	1
lifted	1
her	1
veil,	1
banding	1
it	1
like	1
a	1
nun’s	1
coif	1
across	1
her	1
forehead,	1
and	1
the	1
smile	1
of	1
her	1
dark	1
eyes	1
below	1
this	1
seemed	1
to	1
Swithin	1
more	1
charming	1
than	1
ever.	1
He	1
nodded.	1
She	1
would	1
take	1
his	1
advice	1
he	1
saw.	1
He	1
had	1
little	1
to	1
say	1
of	1
the	1
drawing	1
or	1
dining-rooms,	1
which	1
he	1
described	1
as	1
“spacious”;	1
but	1
fell	1
into	1
such	1
raptures	1
as	1
he	1
permitted	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
his	1
dignity,	1
in	1
the	1
wine-cellar,	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
descended	1
by	1
stone	1
steps,	1
Bosinney	1
going	1
first	1
with	1
a	1
light.	1
“You’ll	1
have	1
room	1
here,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“for	1
six	1
or	1
seven	1
hundred	1
dozen	1
—	1
a	1
very	1
pooty	1
little	1
cellar!”	1
Bosinney	1
having	1
expressed	1
the	1
wish	1
to	1
show	1
them	1
the	1
house	1
from	1
the	1
copse	1
below,	1
Swithin	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
stop.	1
“There’s	1
a	1
fine	1
view	1
from	1
here,”	1
he	1
remarked;	1
“you	1
haven’t	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
as	1
a	1
chair?”	1
A	1
chair	1
was	1
brought	1
him	1
from	1
Bosinney’s	1
tent.	1
“You	1
go	1
down,”	1
he	1
said	1
blandly;	1
“you	1
two!	1
I’ll	1
sit	1
here	1
and	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
view.”	1
He	1
sat	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
oak	1
tree,	1
in	1
the	1
sun;	1
square	1
and	1
upright,	1
with	1
one	1
hand	1
stretched	1
out,	1
resting	1
on	1
the	1
nob	1
of	1
his	1
cane,	1
the	1
other	1
planted	1
on	1
his	1
knee;	1
his	1
fur	1
coat	1
thrown	1
open,	1
his	1
hat,	1
roofing	1
with	1
its	1
flat	1
top	1
the	1
pale	1
square	1
of	1
his	1
face;	1
his	1
stare,	1
very	1
blank,	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
landscape.	1
He	1
nodded	1
to	1
them	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
off	1
down	1
through	1
the	1
fields.	1
He	1
was,	1
indeed,	1
not	1
sorry	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
thus	1
for	1
a	1
quiet	1
moment	1
of	1
reflection.	1
The	1
air	1
was	1
balmy,	1
not	1
too	1
much	1
heat	1
in	1
the	1
sun;	1
the	1
prospect	1
a	1
fine	1
one,	1
a	1
remarka.	1
.	3
His	1
head	1
fell	1
a	1
little	1
to	1
one	1
side;	1
he	1
jerked	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
thought:	1
Odd!	1
He	1
—	1
ah!	1
They	1
were	1
waving	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
bottom!	1
He	1
put	1
up	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
moved	1
it	1
more	1
than	1
once.	1
They	1
were	1
active	1
—	1
the	1
prospect	1
was	1
remar.	1
.	3
His	1
head	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
left,	1
he	1
jerked	1
it	1
up	1
at	1
once;	1
it	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
right.	1
It	1
remained	1
there;	1
he	1
was	1
asleep.	1
And	1
asleep,	1
a	1
sentinel	1
on	1
the	1
—	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
rise,	1
he	1
appeared	1
to	1
rule	1
over	1
this	1
prospect	1
—	1
remarkable	1
—	1
like	1
some	1
image	1
blocked	1
out	1
by	1
the	1
special	1
artist,	1
of	1
primeval	1
Forsytes	1
in	1
pagan	1
days,	1
to	1
record	1
the	1
domination	1
of	1
mind	1
over	1
matter!	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
unnumbered	1
generations	1
of	1
his	1
yeoman	1
ancestors,	1
wont	1
of	1
a	1
Sunday	1
to	1
stand	1
akimbo	1
surveying	1
their	1
little	1
plots	1
of	1
land,	1
their	1
grey	1
unmoving	1
eyes	1
hiding	1
their	1
instinct	1
with	1
its	1
hidden	1
roots	1
of	1
violence,	1
their	1
instinct	1
for	1
possession	1
to	1
the	1
exclusion	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
—	1
all	1
these	1
unnumbered	1
generations	1
seemed	1
to	1
sit	1
there	1
with	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
rise.	1
But	1
from	1
him,	1
thus	1
slumbering,	1
his	1
jealous	1
Forsyte	1
spirit	1
travelled	1
far,	1
into	1
God-knows-what	1
jungle	1
of	1
fancies;	1
with	1
those	1
two	1
young	1
people,	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
doing	1
down	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
copse	1
—	1
in	1
the	1
copse	1
where	1
the	1
spring	1
was	1
running	1
riot	1
with	1
the	1
scent	1
of	1
sap	1
and	1
bursting	1
buds,	1
the	1
song	1
of	1
birds	1
innumerable,	1
a	1
carpet	1
of	1
bluebells	1
and	1
sweet	1
growing	1
things,	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
caught	1
like	1
gold	1
in	1
the	1
tops	1
of	1
the	1
trees;	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
doing,	1
walking	1
along	1
there	1
so	1
close	1
together	1
on	1
the	1
path	1
that	1
was	1
too	1
narrow;	1
walking	1
along	1
there	1
so	1
close	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
always	1
touching;	1
to	1
watch	1
Irene’s	1
eyes,	1
like	1
dark	1
thieves,	1
stealing	1
the	1
heart	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
spring.	1
And	1
a	1
great	1
unseen	1
chaperon,	1
his	1
spirit	1
was	1
there,	1
stopping	1
with	1
them	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
little	1
furry	1
corpse	1
of	1
a	1
mole,	1
not	1
dead	1
an	1
hour,	1
with	1
his	1
mushroom-and-silver	1
coat	1
untouched	1
by	1
the	1
rain	1
or	1
dew;	1
watching	1
over	1
Irene’s	1
bent	1
head,	1
and	1
the	1
soft	1
look	1
of	1
her	1
pitying	1
eyes;	1
and	1
over	1
that	1
young	1
man’s	1
head,	1
gazing	1
at	1
her	1
so	1
hard,	1
so	1
strangely.	1
Walking	1
on	1
with	1
them,	1
too,	1
across	1
the	1
open	1
space	1
where	1
a	1
wood-cutter	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
work,	1
where	1
the	1
bluebells	1
were	1
trampled	1
down,	1
and	1
a	1
trunk	1
had	1
swayed	1
and	1
staggered	1
down	1
from	1
its	1
gashed	1
stump.	1
Climbing	1
it	1
with	1
them,	1
over,	1
and	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
copse,	1
whence	1
there	1
stretched	1
an	1
undiscovered	1
country,	1
from	1
far	1
away	1
in	1
which	1
came	1
the	1
sounds,	1
‘Cuckoo-cuckoo!’	1
Silent,	1
standing	1
with	1
them	1
there,	1
and	1
uneasy	1
at	1
their	1
silence!	1
Very	1
queer,	1
very	1
strange!	1
Then	1
back	1
again,	1
as	1
though	1
guilty,	1
through	1
the	1
wood	1
—	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
cutting,	1
still	1
silent,	1
amongst	1
the	1
songs	1
of	1
birds	1
that	1
never	1
ceased,	1
and	1
the	1
wild	1
scent	1
—	1
hum!	1
what	1
was	1
it	1
—	1
like	1
that	1
herb	1
they	1
put	1
in	1
—	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
log	1
across	1
the	1
path.	1
.	3
And	1
then	1
unseen,	1
uneasy,	1
flapping	1
above	1
them,	1
trying	1
to	1
make	1
noises,	1
his	1
Forsyte	1
spirit	1
watched	1
her	1
balanced	1
on	1
the	1
log,	1
her	1
pretty	1
figure	1
swaying,	1
smiling	1
down	1
at	1
that	1
young	1
man	1
gazing	1
up	1
with	1
such	1
strange,	1
shining	1
eyes,	1
slipping	1
now	1
—	1
a	1
—	1
ah!	1
falling,	1
o	1
—	1
oh!	1
sliding	1
—	1
down	1
his	1
breast;	1
her	1
soft,	1
warm	1
body	1
clutched,	1
her	1
head	1
bent	1
back	1
from	1
his	1
lips;	1
his	1
kiss;	1
her	1
recoil;	1
his	1
cry:	1
“You	1
must	1
know	1
—	1
I	1
love	1
you!”	1
Must	1
know	1
—	1
indeed,	1
a	1
pretty	1
.	2
.?	1
Love!	1
Hah!	1
Swithin	1
awoke;	1
virtue	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
him.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
taste	1
in	1
his	1
mouth.	1
Where	1
was	1
he?	1
Damme!	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
asleep!	1
He	1
had	1
dreamed	1
something	1
about	1
a	1
new	1
soup,	1
with	1
a	1
taste	1
of	1
mint	1
in	1
it.	1
Those	1
young	1
people	1
—	1
where	1
had	1
they	1
got	1
to?	1
His	1
left	1
leg	1
had	1
pins	1
and	1
needles.	1
“Adolf!”	1
The	1
rascal	1
was	1
not	1
there;	1
the	1
rascal	1
was	1
asleep	1
somewhere.	1
He	1
stood	1
up,	1
tall,	1
square,	1
bulky	1
in	1
his	1
fur,	1
looking	1
anxiously	1
down	1
over	1
the	1
fields,	1
and	1
presently	1
he	1
saw	1
them	1
coming.	1
Irene	1
was	1
in	1
front;	1
that	1
young	1
fellow	1
—	1
what	1
had	1
they	1
nicknamed	1
him	1
—‘The	1
Buccaneer?’	1
looked	1
precious	1
hangdog	1
there	1
behind	1
her;	1
had	1
got	1
a	1
flea	1
in	1
his	1
ear,	1
he	1
shouldn’t	1
wonder.	1
Serve	1
him	1
right,	1
taking	1
her	1
down	1
all	1
that	1
way	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
house!	1
The	1
proper	1
place	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
a	1
house	1
from	1
was	1
the	1
lawn.	1
They	1
saw	1
him.	1
He	1
extended	1
his	1
arm,	1
and	1
moved	1
it	1
spasmodically	1
to	1
encourage	1
them.	1
But	1
they	1
had	1
stopped.	1
What	1
were	1
they	1
standing	1
there	1
for,	1
talking	1
—	1
talking?	1
They	1
came	1
on	1
again.	1
She	1
had	1
been,	1
giving	1
him	1
a	1
rub,	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
least	1
doubt	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
no	1
wonder,	1
over	1
a	1
house	1
like	1
that	1
—	1
a	1
great	1
ugly	1
thing,	1
not	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
house	1
he	1
was	1
accustomed	1
to.	1
He	1
looked	1
intently	1
at	1
their	1
faces,	1
with	1
his	1
pale,	1
immovable	1
stare.	1
That	1
young	1
man	1
looked	1
very	1
queer!	1
“You’ll	1
never	1
make	1
anything	1
of	1
this!”	1
he	1
said	1
tartly,	1
pointing	1
at	1
the	1
mansion;	1
—“too	1
newfangled!”	1
Bosinney	1
gazed	1
at	1
him	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
heard;	1
and	1
Swithin	1
afterwards	1
described	1
him	1
to	1
Aunt	1
Hester	1
as	1
“an	1
extravagant	1
sort	1
of	1
fellow	1
very	1
odd	1
way	1
of	1
looking	1
at	1
you	1
—	1
a	1
bumpy	1
beggar!”	1
What	1
gave	1
rise	1
to	1
this	1
sudden	1
piece	1
of	1
psychology	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
state;	1
possibly	1
Bosinney’s,	1
prominent	1
forehead	1
and	1
cheekbones	1
and	1
chin,	1
or	1
something	1
hungry	1
in	1
his	1
face,	1
which	1
quarrelled	1
with	1
Swithin’s	1
conception	1
of	1
the	1
calm	1
satiety	1
that	1
should	1
characterize	1
the	1
perfect	1
gentleman.	1
He	1
brightened	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
mention	1
of	1
tea.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
contempt	1
for	1
tea	1
—	1
his	1
brother	1
Jolyon	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
tea;	1
made	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
money	1
by	1
it	1
—	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
thirsty,	1
and	1
had	1
such	1
a	1
taste	1
in	1
his	1
mouth,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
prepared	1
to	1
drink	1
anything.	1
He	1
longed	1
to	1
inform	1
Irene	1
of	1
the	1
taste	1
in	1
his	1
mouth	1
—	1
she	1
was	1
so	1
sympathetic	1
—	1
but	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
distinguished	1
thing	1
to	1
do;	1
he	1
rolled	1
his	1
tongue	1
round,	1
and	1
faintly	1
smacked	1
it	1
against	1
his	1
palate.	1
In	1
a	1
far	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
tent	1
Adolf	1
was	1
bending	1
his	1
cat-like	1
moustaches	1
over	1
a	1
kettle.	1
He	1
left	1
it	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
draw	1
the	1
cork	1
of	1
a	1
pint-bottle	1
of	1
champagne.	1
Swithin	1
smiled,	1
and,	1
nodding	1
at	1
Bosinney,	1
said:	1
“Why,	1
you’re	1
quite	1
a	1
Monte	1
Cristo!”	1
This	1
celebrated	1
novel	1
—	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
half-dozen	1
he	1
had	1
read	1
—	1
had	1
produced	1
an	1
extraordinary	1
impression	1
on	1
his	1
mind.	1
Taking	1
his	1
glass	1
from	1
the	1
table,	1
he	1
held	1
it	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
to	1
scrutinize	1
the	1
colour;	1
thirsty	1
as	1
he	1
was,	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
likely	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
drink	1
trash!	1
Then,	1
placing	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
lips,	1
he	1
took	1
a	1
sip.	1
“A	1
very	1
nice	1
wine,”	1
he	1
said	1
at	1
last,	1
passing	1
it	1
before	1
his	1
nose;	1
“not	1
the	1
equal	1
of	1
my	1
Heidsieck!”	1
It	1
was	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
that	1
the	1
idea	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
which	1
he	1
afterwards	1
imparted	1
at	1
Timothy’s	1
in	1
this	1
nutshell:	1
“I	1
shouldn’t	1
wonder	1
a	1
bit	1
if	1
that	1
architect	1
chap	1
were	1
sweet	1
upon	1
Mrs.	1
Soames!”	1
And	1
from	1
this	1
moment	1
his	1
pale,	1
round	1
eyes	1
never	1
ceased	1
to	1
bulge	1
with	1
the	1
interest	1
of	1
his	1
discovery.	1
“The	1
fellow,”	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Septimus,	1
“follows	1
her	1
about	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
like	1
a	1
dog	1
—	1
the	1
bumpy	1
beggar!	1
I	1
don’t	1
wonder	1
at	1
it	1
—	1
she’s	1
a	1
very	1
charming	1
woman,	1
and,	1
I	1
should	1
say,	1
the	1
pink	1
of	1
discretion!”	1
A	1
vague	1
consciousness	1
of	1
perfume	1
caging	1
about	1
Irene,	1
like	1
that	1
from	1
a	1
flower	1
with	1
half-closed	1
petals	1
and	1
a	1
passionate	1
heart,	1
moved	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
creation	1
of	1
this	1
image.	1
“But	1
I	1
wasn’t	1
sure	1
of	1
it,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“till	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
pick	1
up	1
her	1
handkerchief.”	1
Mrs.	1
Small’s	1
eyes	1
boiled	1
with	1
excitement.	1
“And	1
did	1
he	1
give	1
it	1
her	1
back?”	1
she	1
asked.	1
“Give	1
it	1
back?”	1
said	1
Swithin:	1
“I	1
saw	1
him	1
slobber	1
on	1
it	1
when	1
he	1
thought	1
I	1
wasn’t	1
looking!”	1
Mrs.	1
Small	1
gasped	1
—	1
too	1
interested	1
to	1
speak.	1
“But	1
she	1
gave	1
him	1
no	1
encouragement,”	1
went	1
on	1
Swithin;	1
he	1
stopped,	1
and	1
stared	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
or	1
two	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
alarmed	1
Aunt	1
Hester	1
so	1
—	1
he	1
had	1
suddenly	1
recollected	1
that,	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
starting	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
phaeton,	1
she	1
had	1
given	1
Bosinney	1
her	1
hand	1
a	1
second	1
time,	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
stay	1
there	1
too.	1
.	3
He	1
had	1
touched	1
his	1
horses	1
smartly	1
with	1
the	1
whip,	1
anxious	1
to	1
get	1
her	1
all	1
to	1
himself.	1
But	1
she	1
had	1
looked	1
back,	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
answered	1
his	1
first	1
question;	1
neither	1
had	1
he	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
face	1
—	1
she	1
had	1
kept	1
it	1
hanging	1
down.	1
There	1
is	1
somewhere	1
a	1
picture,	1
which	1
Swithin	1
has	1
not	1
seen,	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
rock,	1
and	1
by	1
him,	1
immersed	1
in	1
the	1
still,	1
green	1
water,	1
a	1
sea-nymph	1
lying	1
on	1
her	1
back,	1
with	1
her	1
hand	1
on	1
her	1
naked	1
breast.	1
She	1
has	1
a	1
half-smile	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
—	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
hopeless	1
surrender	1
and	1
of	1
secret	1
joy.	1
Seated	1
by	1
Swithin’s	1
side,	1
Irene	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
smiling	1
like	1
that.	1
When,	1
warmed	1
by	1
champagne,	1
he	1
had	1
her	1
all	1
to	1
himself,	1
he	1
unbosomed	1
himself	1
of	1
his	1
wrongs;	1
of	1
his	1
smothered	1
resentment	1
against	1
the	1
new	1
chef	1
at	1
the	1
club;	1
his	1
worry	1
over	1
the	1
house	1
in	1
Wigmore	1
Street,	1
where	1
the	1
rascally	1
tenant	1
had	1
gone	1
bankrupt	1
through	1
helping	1
his	1
brother-in-law	1
as	1
if	1
charity	1
did	1
not	1
begin	1
at	1
home;	1
of	1
his	1
deafness,	1
too,	1
and	1
that	1
pain	1
he	1
sometimes	1
got	1
in	1
his	1
right	1
side.	1
She	1
listened,	1
her	1
eyes	1
swimming	1
under	1
their	1
lids.	1
He	1
thought	1
she	1
was	1
thinking	1
deeply	1
of	1
his	1
troubles,	1
and	1
pitied	1
himself	1
terribly.	1
Yet	1
in	1
his	1
fur	1
coat,	1
with	1
frogs	1
across	1
the	1
breast,	1
his	1
top	1
hat	1
aslant,	1
driving	1
this	1
beautiful	1
woman,	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
felt	1
more	1
distinguished.	1
A	1
coster,	1
however,	1
taking	1
his	1
girl	1
for	1
a	1
Sunday	1
airing,	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
same	1
impression	1
about	1
himself.	1
This	1
person	1
had	1
flogged	1
his	1
donkey	1
into	1
a	1
gallop	1
alongside,	1
and	1
sat,	1
upright	1
as	1
a	1
waxwork,	1
in	1
his	1
shallopy	1
chariot,	1
his	1
chin	1
settled	1
pompously	1
on	1
a	1
red	1
handkerchief,	1
like	1
Swithin’s	1
on	1
his	1
full	1
cravat;	1
while	1
his	1
girl,	1
with	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
a	1
fly-blown	1
boa	1
floating	1
out	1
behind,	1
aped	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
fashion.	1
Her	1
swain	1
moved	1
a	1
stick	1
with	1
a	1
ragged	1
bit	1
of	1
string	1
dangling	1
from	1
the	1
end,	1
reproducing	1
with	1
strange	1
fidelity	1
the	1
circular	1
flourish	1
of	1
Swithin’s	1
whip,	1
and	1
rolled	1
his	1
head	1
at	1
his	1
lady	1
with	1
a	1
leer	1
that	1
had	1
a	1
weird	1
likeness	1
to	1
Swithin’s	1
primeval	1
stare.	1
Though	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
unconscious	1
of	1
the	1
lowly	1
ruffian’s	1
presence,	1
Swithin	1
presently	1
took	1
it	1
into	1
his	1
head	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
being	1
guyed.	1
He	1
laid	1
his	1
whip-lash	1
across	1
the	1
mares	1
flank.	1
The	1
two	1
chariots,	1
however,	1
by	1
some	1
unfortunate	1
fatality	1
continued	1
abreast.	1
Swithin’s	1
yellow,	1
puffy	1
face	1
grew	1
red;	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
whip	1
to	1
lash	1
the	1
costermonger,	1
but	1
was	1
saved	1
from	1
so	1
far	1
forgetting	1
his	1
dignity	1
by	1
a	1
special	1
intervention	1
of	1
Providence.	1
A	1
carriage	1
driving	1
out	1
through	1
a	1
gate	1
forced	1
phaeton	1
and	1
donkey-cart	1
into	1
proximity;	1
the	1
wheels	1
grated,	1
the	1
lighter	1
vehicle	1
skidded,	1
and	1
was	1
overturned.	1
Swithin	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
round.	1
On	1
no	1
account	1
would	1
he	1
have	1
pulled	1
up	1
to	1
help	1
the	1
ruffian.	1
Serve	1
him	1
right	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
broken	1
his	1
neck!	1
But	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
if	1
he	1
would.	1
The	1
greys	1
had	1
taken	1
alarm.	1
The	1
phaeton	1
swung	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side,	1
and	1
people	1
raised	1
frightened	1
faces	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
dashing	1
past.	1
Swithin’s	1
great	1
arms,	1
stretched	1
at	1
full	1
length,	1
tugged	1
at	1
the	1
reins.	1
His	1
cheeks	1
were	1
puffed,	1
his	1
lips	1
compressed,	1
his	1
swollen	1
face	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
dull,	1
angry	1
red.	1
Irene	1
had	1
her	1
hand	1
on	1
the	1
rail,	1
and	1
at	1
every	1
lurch	1
she	1
gripped	1
it	1
tightly.	1
Swithin	1
heard	1
her	1
ask:	1
“Are	1
we	1
going	1
to	1
have	1
an	1
accident,	1
Uncle	1
Swithin?”	1
He	1
gasped	1
out	1
between	1
his	1
pants:	1
“It’s	1
nothing;	1
a	1
—	1
little	1
fresh!”	1
“I’ve	1
never	1
been	1
in	1
an	1
accident.”	1
“Don’t	1
you	1
move!”	1
He	1
took	1
a	1
look	1
at	1
her.	1
She	1
was	1
smiling,	1
perfectly	1
calm.	1
“Sit	1
still,”	1
he	1
repeated.	1
“Never	1
fear,	1
I’ll	1
get	1
you	1
home!”	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
terrible	1
efforts,	1
he	1
was	1
surprised	1
to	1
hear	1
her	1
answer	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
not	1
like	1
her	1
own:	1
“I	1
don’t	1
care	1
if	1
I	1
never	1
get	1
home!”	1
The	1
carriage	1
giving	1
a	1
terrific	1
lurch,	1
Swithin’s	1
exclamation	1
was	1
jerked	1
back	1
into	1
his	1
throat.	1
The	1
horses,	1
winded	1
by	1
the	1
rise	1
of	1
a	1
hill,	1
now	1
steadied	1
to	1
a	1
trot,	1
and	1
finally	1
stopped	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
accord.	1
“When”—	1
Swithin	1
described	1
it	1
at	1
Timothy’s	1
—“I	1
pulled	1
’em	1
up,	1
there	1
she	1
was	1
as	1
cool	1
as	1
myself.	1
God	1
bless	1
my	1
soul!	1
she	1
behaved	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
didn’t	1
care	1
whether	1
she	1
broke	1
her	1
neck	1
or	1
not!	1
What	1
was	1
it	1
she	1
said:	1
‘I	1
don’t	1
care	1
if	1
I	1
never	1
get	1
home?”	1
Leaning	1
over	1
the	1
handle	1
of	1
his	1
cane,	1
he	1
wheezed	1
out,	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Small’s	1
terror:	1
“And	1
I’m	1
not	1
altogether	1
surprised,	1
with	1
a	1
finickin’	1
feller	1
like	1
young	1
Soames	1
for	1
a	1
husband!”	1
It	1
did	1
not	1
occur	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
wonder	1
what	1
Bosinney	1
had	1
done	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
left	1
him	1
there	1
alone;	1
whether	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
wandering	1
about	1
like	1
the	1
dog	1
to	1
which	1
Swithin	1
had	1
compared	1
him;	1
wandering	1
down	1
to	1
that	1
copse	1
where	1
the	1
spring	1
was	1
still	1
in	1
riot,	1
the	1
cuckoo	1
still	1
calling	1
from	1
afar;	1
gone	1
down	1
there	1
with	1
her	1
handkerchief	1
pressed	1
to	1
lips,	1
its	1
fragrance	1
mingling	1
with	1
the	1
scent	1
of	1
mint	1
and	1
thyme.	1
Gone	1
down	1
there	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
wild,	1
exquisite	1
pain	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
cried	1
out	1
among	1
the	1
trees.	1
Or	1
what,	1
indeed,	1
the	1
fellow	1
had	1
done.	1
In	1
fact,	1
till	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
Timothy’s,	1
Swithin	1
had	1
forgotten	1
all	1
about	1
him.	1

his	1
memorable	1
drive,	1
the	1
same,	1
with	1
the	1
least	1
suspicion	1
of	1
curiosity,	1
the	1
merest	1
touch	1
of	1
malice,	1
and	1
a	1
real	1
desire	1
to	1
do	1
good,	1
was	1
passed	1
on	1
to	1
June.	1
“And	1
what	1
a	1
dreadful	1
thing	1
to	1
say,	1
my	1
dear!”	1
ended	1
Aunt	1
Juley;	1
“that	1
about	1
not	1
going	1
home.	1
What	1
did	1
she	1
mean?”	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
strange	1
recital	1
for	1
the	1
girl.	1
She	1
heard	1
it	1
flushing	1
painfully,	1
and,	1
suddenly,	1
with	1
a	1
curt	1
handshake,	1
took	1
her	1
departure.	1
“Almost	1
rude!”	1
Mrs.	1
Small	1
said	1
to	1
Aunt	1
Hester,	1
when	1
June	1
was	1
gone.	1
The	1
proper	1
construction	1
was	1
put	1
on	1
her	1
reception	1
of	1
the	1
news.	1
She	1
was	1
upset.	1
Something	1
was	1
therefore	1
very	1
wrong.	1
Odd!	1
She	1
and	1
Irene	1
had	1
been	1
such	1
friends!	1
It	1
all	1
tallied	1
too	1
well	1
with	1
whispers	1
and	1
hints	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
going	1
about	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
past.	1
Recollections	1
of	1
Euphemia’s	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
visit	1
to	1
the	1
theatre	1
—	1
Mr.	1
Bosinney	1
always	1
at	1
Soames’s?	1
Oh,	1
indeed!	1
Yes,	1
of	1
course,	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
about	1
the	1
house!	1
Nothing	1
open.	1
Only	1
upon	1
the	1
greatest,	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
provocation	1
was	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
say	1
anything	1
open	1
on	1
Forsyte	1
‘Change.	1
This	1
machine	1
was	1
too	1
nicely	1
adjusted;	1
a	1
hint,	1
the	1
merest	1
trifling	1
expression	1
of	1
regret	1
or	1
doubt,	1
sufficed	1
to	1
set	1
the	1
family	1
soul	1
so	1
sympathetic	1
—	1
vibrating.	1
No	1
one	1
desired	1
that	1
harm	1
should	1
come	1
of	1
these	1
vibrations	1
—	1
far	1
from	1
it;	1
they	1
were	1
set	1
in	1
motion	1
with	1
the	1
best	1
intentions,	1
with	1
the	1
feeling,	1
that	1
each	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
had	1
a	1
stake	1
in	1
the	1
family	1
soul.	1
And	1
much	1
kindness	1
lay	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
gossip;	1
it	1
would	1
frequently	1
result	1
in	1
visits	1
of	1
condolence	1
being	1
made,	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
the	1
customs	1
of	1
Society,	1
thereby	1
conferring	1
a	1
real	1
benefit	1
upon	1
the	1
sufferers,	1
and	1
affording	1
consolation	1
to	1
the	1
sound,	1
who	1
felt	1
pleasantly	1
that	1
someone	1
at	1
all	1
events	1
was	1
suffering	1
from	1
that	1
from	1
which	1
they	1
themselves	1
were	1
not	1
suffering.	1
In	1
fact,	1
it	1
was	1
simply	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
keep	1
things	1
well-aired,	1
the	1
desire	1
which	1
animates	1
the	1
Public	1
Press,	1
that	1
brought	1
James,	1
for	1
instance,	1
into	1
communication	1
with	1
Mrs.	1
Septimus,	1
Mrs.	1
Septimus,	1
with	1
the	1
little	1
Nicholases,	1
the	1
little	1
Nicholases	1
with	1
who-knows-whom,	1
and	1
so	1
on.	1
That	1
great	1
class	1
to	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
risen,	1
and	1
now	1
belonged,	1
demanded	1
a	1
certain	1
candour,	1
a	1
still	1
more	1
certain	1
reticence.	1
This	1
combination	1
guaranteed	1
their	1
membership.	1
Many	1
of	1
the	1
younger	1
Forsytes	1
felt,	1
very	1
naturally,	1
and	1
would	1
openly	1
declare,	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
their	1
affairs	1
pried	1
into;	1
but	1
so	1
powerful	1
was	1
the	1
invisible,	1
magnetic	1
current	1
of	1
family	1
gossip,	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
them	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
knowing	1
all	1
about	1
everything.	1
It	1
was	1
felt	1
to	1
be	1
hopeless.	1
One	1
of	1
them	1
(young	1
Roger)	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
heroic	1
attempt	1
to	1
free	1
the	1
rising	1
generation,	1
by	1
speaking	1
of	1
Timothy	1
as	1
an	1
‘old	1
cat.’	1
The	1
effort	1
had	1
justly	1
recoiled	1
upon	1
himself;	1
the	1
words,	1
coming	1
round	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
delicate	1
way	1
to	1
Aunt	1
Juley’s	1
ears,	1
were	1
repeated	1
by	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
shocked	1
voice	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Roger,	1
whence	1
they	1
returned	1
again	1
to	1
young	1
Roger.	1
And,	1
after	1
all,	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
the	1
wrong-doers	1
who	1
suffered;	1
as,	1
for	1
instance,	1
George,	1
when	1
he	1
lost	1
all	1
that	1
money	1
playing	1
billiards;	1
or	1
young	1
Roger	1
himself,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
dreadfully	1
near	1
to	1
marrying	1
the	1
girl	1
to	1
whom,	1
it	1
was	1
whispered,	1
he	1
was	1
already	1
married	1
by	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
Nature;	1
or	1
again	1
Irene,	1
who	1
was	1
thought,	1
rather	1
than	1
said,	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
danger.	1
All	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
only	1
pleasant	1
but	1
salutary.	1
And	1
it	1
made	1
so	1
many	1
hours	1
go	1
lightly	1
at	1
Timothy’s	1
in	1
the	1
Bayswater	1
Road;	1
so	1
many	1
hours	1
that	1
must	1
otherwise	1
have	1
been	1
sterile	1
and	1
heavy	1
to	1
those	1
three	1
who	1
lived	1
there;	1
and	1
Timothy’s	1
was	1
but	1
one	1
of	1
hundreds	1
of	1
such	1
homes	1
in	1
this	1
City	1
of	1
London	1
—	1
the	1
homes	1
of	1
neutral	1
persons	1
of	1
the	1
secure	1
classes,	1
who	1
are	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
themselves,	1
and	1
must	1
find	1
their	1
reason	1
for	1
existing,	1
in	1
the	1
battles	1
of	1
others.	1
But	1
for	1
the	1
sweetness	1
of	1
family	1
gossip,	1
it	1
must	1
indeed	1
have	1
been	1
lonely	1
there.	1
Rumours	1
and	1
tales,	1
reports,	1
surmises	1
—	1
were	1
they	1
not	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
as	1
dear	1
and	1
precious	1
as	1
the	1
prattling	1
babes	1
the	1
brother	1
and	1
sisters	1
had	1
missed	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
journey?	1
To	1
talk	1
about	1
them	1
was	1
as	1
near	1
as	1
they	1
could	1
get	1
to	1
the	1
possession	1
of	1
all	1
those	1
children	1
and	1
grandchildren,	1
after	1
whom	1
their	1
soft	1
hearts	1
yearned.	1
For	1
though	1
it	1
is	1
doubtful	1
whether	1
Timothy’s	1
heart	1
yearned,	1
it	1
is	1
indubitable	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
each	1
fresh	1
Forsyte	1
child	1
he	1
was	1
quite	1
upset.	1
Useless	1
for	1
young	1
Roger	1
to	1
say,	1
“Old	1
cat!”	1
for	1
Euphemia	1
to	1
hold	1
up	1
her	1
hands	1
and	1
cry:	1
“Oh!	1
those	1
three!”	1
and	1
break	1
into	1
her	1
silent	1
laugh	1
with	1
the	1
squeak	1
at	1
the	1
end.	1
Useless,	1
and	1
not	1
too	1
kind.	1
The	1
situation	1
which	1
at	1
this	1
stage	1
might	1
seem,	1
and	1
especially	1
to	1
Forsyte	1
eyes,	1
strange	1
—	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
‘impossible’—	1
was,	1
in	1
view	1
of	1
certain	1
facts,	1
not	1
so	1
strange	1
after	1
all.	1
Some	1
things	1
had	1
been	1
lost	1
sight	1
of.	1
And	1
first,	1
in	1
the	1
security	1
bred	1
of	1
many	1
harmless	1
marriages,	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
forgotten	1
that	1
Love	1
is	1
no	1
hot-house	1
flower,	1
but	1
a	1
wild	1
plant,	1
born	1
of	1
a	1
wet	1
night,	1
born	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
of	1
sunshine;	1
sprung	1
from	1
wild	1
seed,	1
blown	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
by	1
a	1
wild	1
wind.	1
A	1
wild	1
plant	1
that,	1
when	1
it	1
blooms	1
by	1
chance	1
within	1
the	1
hedge	1
of	1
our	1
gardens,	1
we	1
call	1
a	1
flower;	1
and	1
when	1
it	1
blooms	1
outside	1
we	1
call	1
a	1
weed;	1
but,	1
flower	1
or	1
weed,	1
whose	1
scent	1
and	1
colour	1
are	1
always,	1
wild!	1
And	1
further	1
—	1
the	1
facts	1
and	1
figures	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
lives	1
being	1
against	1
the	1
perception	1
of	1
this	1
truth	1
—	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
generally	1
recognised	1
by	1
Forsytes	1
that,	1
where,	1
this	1
wild	1
plant	1
springs,	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
are	1
but	1
moths	1
around	1
the	1
pale,	1
flame-like	1
blossom.	1
It	1
was	1
long	1
since	1
young	1
Jolyon’s	1
escapade	1
—	1
there	1
was	1
danger	1
of	1
a	1
tradition	1
again	1
arising	1
that	1
people	1
in	1
their	1
position	1
never	1
cross	1
the	1
hedge	1
to	1
pluck	1
that	1
flower;	1
that	1
one	1
could	1
reckon	1
on	1
having	1
love,	1
like	1
measles,	1
once	1
in	1
due	1
season,	1
and	1
getting	1
over	1
it	1
comfortably	1
for	1
all	1
time	1
—	1
as	1
with	1
measles,	1
on	1
a	1
soothing	1
mixture	1
of	1
butter	1
and	1
honey	1
—	1
in	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
wedlock.	1
Of	1
all	1
those	1
whom	1
this	1
strange	1
rumour	1
about	1
Bosinney	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Soames	1
reached,	1
James	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
affected.	1
He	1
had	1
long	1
forgotten	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
hovered,	1
lanky	1
and	1
pale,	1
in	1
side	1
whiskers	1
of	1
chestnut	1
hue,	1
round	1
Emily,	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
courtship.	1
He	1
had	1
long	1
forgotten	1
the	1
small	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
purlieus	1
of	1
Mayfair,	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
spent	1
the	1
early	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
married	1
life,	1
or	1
rather,	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
forgotten	1
the	1
early	1
days,	1
not	1
the	1
small	1
house	1
—	1
a	1
Forsyte	1
never	1
forgot	1
a	1
house	1
—	1
he	1
had	1
afterwards	1
sold	1
it	1
at	1
a	1
clear	1
profit	1
of	1
four	1
hundred	1
pounds.	1
He	1
had	1
long	1
forgotten	1
those	1
days,	1
with	1
their	1
hopes	1
and	1
fears	1
and	1
doubts	1
about	1
the	1
prudence	1
of	1
the	1
match	1
(for	1
Emily,	1
though	1
pretty,	1
had	1
nothing,	1
and	1
he	1
himself	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
was	1
making	1
a	1
bare	1
thousand	1
a	1
year),	1
and	1
that	1
strange,	1
irresistible	1
attraction	1
which	1
had	1
drawn	1
him	1
on,	1
till	1
he	1
felt	1
he	1
must	1
die	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
marry	1
the	1
girl	1
with	1
the	1
fair	1
hair,	1
looped	1
so	1
neatly	1
back,	1
the	1
fair	1
arms	1
emerging	1
from	1
a	1
skin-tight	1
bodice,	1
the	1
fair	1
form	1
decorously	1
shielded	1
by	1
a	1
cage	1
of	1
really	1
stupendous	1
circumference.	1
James	1
had	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
fire,	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
passed	1
also	1
through	1
the	1
river	1
of	1
years	1
which	1
washes	1
out	1
the	1
fire;	1
he	1
had	1
experienced	1
the	1
saddest	1
experience	1
of	1
all	1
—	1
forgetfulness	1
of	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
like	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
love.	1
Forgotten!	1
Forgotten	1
so	1
long,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
forgotten	1
even	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
forgotten.	1
And	1
now	1
this	1
rumour	1
had	1
come	1
upon	1
him,	1
this	1
rumour	1
about	1
his	1
son’s	1
wife;	1
very	1
vague,	1
a	1
shadow	1
dodging	1
among	1
the	1
palpable,	1
straightforward	1
appearances	1
of	1
things,	1
unreal,	1
unintelligible	1
as	1
a	1
ghost,	1
but	1
carrying	1
with	1
it,	1
like	1
a	1
ghost,	1
inexplicable	1
terror.	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
bring	1
it	1
home	1
to	1
his	1
mind,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
more	1
use	1
than	1
trying	1
to	1
apply	1
to	1
himself	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
tragedies	1
he	1
read	1
of	1
daily	1
in	1
his	1
evening	1
paper.	1
He	1
simply	1
could	1
not.	1
There	1
could	1
be	1
nothing	1
in	1
it.	1
It	1
was	1
all	1
their	1
nonsense.	1
She	1
didn’t	1
get	1
on	1
with	1
Soames	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
she	1
might,	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
little	1
thing	1
—	1
a	1
good	1
little	1
thing!	1
Like	1
the	1
not	1
inconsiderable	1
majority	1
of	1
men,	1
James	1
relished	1
a	1
nice	1
little	1
bit	1
of	1
scandal,	1
and	1
would	1
say,	1
in	1
a	1
matter-of-fact	1
tone,	1
licking	1
his	1
lips,	1
“Yes,	1
yes	1
—	1
she	1
and	1
young	1
Dyson;	1
they	1
tell	1
me	1
they’re	1
living	1
at	1
Monte	1
Carlo!”	1
But	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
an	1
affair	1
of	1
this	1
sort	1
—	1
of	1
its	1
past,	1
its	1
present,	1
or	1
its	1
future	1
—	1
had	1
never	1
struck	1
him.	1
What	1
it	1
meant,	1
what	1
torture	1
and	1
raptures	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
its	1
construction,	1
what	1
slow,	1
overmastering	1
fate	1
had	1
lurked	1
within	1
the	1
facts,	1
very	1
naked,	1
sometimes	1
sordid,	1
but	1
generally	1
spicy,	1
presented	1
to	1
his	1
gaze.	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
blaming,	1
praising,	1
drawing	1
deductions,	1
or	1
generalizing	1
at	1
all	1
about	1
such	1
things;	1
he	1
simply	1
listened	1
rather	1
greedily,	1
and	1
repeated	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
told,	1
finding	1
considerable	1
benefit	1
from	1
the	1
practice,	1
as	1
from	1
the	1
consumption	1
of	1
a	1
sherry	1
and	1
bitters	1
before	1
a	1
meal.	1
Now,	1
however,	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
—	1
or	1
rather	1
the	1
rumour,	1
the	1
breath	1
of	1
it	1
—	1
had	1
come	1
near	1
him	1
personally,	1
he	1
felt	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
fog,	1
which	1
filled	1
his	1
mouth	1
full	1
of	1
a	1
bad,	1
thick	1
flavour,	1
and	1
made	1
it	1
difficult	1
to	1
draw	1
breath.	1
A	1
scandal!	1
A	1
possible	1
scandal!	1
To	1
repeat	1
this	1
word	1
to	1
himself	1
thus	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
focus	1
or	1
make	1
it	1
thinkable.	1
He	1
had	1
forgotten	1
the	1
sensations	1
necessary	1
for	1
understanding	1
the	1
progress,	1
fate,	1
or	1
meaning	1
of	1
any	1
such	1
business;	1
he	1
simply	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
grasp	1
the	1
possibilities	1
of	1
people	1
running	1
any	1
risk	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
passion.	1
Amongst	1
all	1
those	1
persons	1
of	1
his	1
acquaintance,	1
who	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
City	1
day	1
after	1
day	1
and	1
did	1
their	1
business	1
there,	1
whatever	1
it	1
was,	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
leisure	1
moments	1
bought	1
shares,	1
and	1
houses,	1
and	1
ate	1
dinners,	1
and	1
played	1
games,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
told,	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
ridiculous	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
any	1
who	1
would	1
run	1
risks	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
anything	1
so	1
recondite,	1
so	1
figurative,	1
as	1
passion.	1
Passion!	1
He	1
seemed,	1
indeed,	1
to	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
rules	1
such	1
as	1
‘A	1
young	1
man	1
and	1
a	1
young	1
woman	1
ought	1
never	1
to	1
be	1
trusted	1
together’	1
were	1
fixed	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
as	1
the	1
parallels	1
of	1
latitude	1
are	1
fixed	1
on	1
a	1
map	1
(for	1
all	1
Forsytes,	1
when	1
it	1
comes	1
to	1
‘bed-rock’	1
matters	1
of	1
fact,	1
have	1
quite	1
a	1
fine	1
taste	1
in	1
realism);	1
but	1
as	1
to	1
anything	1
else	1
—	1
well,	1
he	1
could	1
only	1
appreciate	1
it	1
at	1
all	1
through	1
the	1
catch-word	1
‘scandal.’	1
Ah!	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
truth	1
in	1
it	1
—	1
could	1
not	1
be.	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
afraid;	1
she	1
was	1
really	1
a	1
good	1
little	1
thing.	1
But	1
there	1
it	1
was	1
when	1
you	1
got	1
a	1
thing	1
like	1
that	1
into	1
your	1
mind.	1
And	1
James	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
nervous	1
temperament	1
—	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
men	1
whom	1
things	1
will	1
not	1
leave	1
alone,	1
who	1
suffer	1
tortures	1
from	1
anticipation	1
and	1
indecision.	1
For	1
fear	1
of	1
letting	1
something	1
slip	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
otherwise	1
secure,	1
he	1
was	1
physically	1
unable	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
until	1
absolutely	1
certain	1
that,	1
by	1
not	1
making	1
it	1
up,	1
he	1
would	1
suffer	1
loss.	1
In	1
life,	1
however,	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
occasions	1
when	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
making	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
rest	1
with	1
himself,	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
them.	1
What	1
could	1
he	1
do?	1
Talk	1
it	1
over	1
with	1
Soames?	1
That	1
would	1
only	1
make	1
matters	1
worse.	1
And,	1
after	1
all,	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
in	1
it,	1
he	1
felt	1
sure.	1
It	1
was	1
all	1
that	1
house.	1
He	1
had	1
mistrusted	1
the	1
idea	1
from	1
the	1
first.	1
What	1
did	1
Soames	1
want	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
country	1
for?	1
And,	1
if	1
he	1
must	1
go	1
spending	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
money	1
building	1
himself	1
a	1
house,	1
why	1
not	1
have	1
a	1
first-rate	1
man,	1
instead	1
of	1
this	1
young	1
Bosinney,	1
whom	1
nobody	1
knew	1
anything	1
about?	1
He	1
had	1
told	1
them	1
how	1
it	1
would	1
be.	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
costing	1
Soames	1
a	1
pretty	1
penny	1
beyond	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
reckoned	1
on	1
spending.	1
This	1
fact,	1
more	1
than	1
any	1
other,	1
brought	1
home	1
to	1
James	1
the	1
real	1
danger	1
of	1
the	1
situation.	1
It	1
was	1
always	1
like	1
this	1
with	1
these	1
‘artistic’	1
chaps;	1
a	1
sensible	1
man	1
should	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
them.	1
He	1
had	1
warned	1
Irene,	1
too.	1
And	1
see	1
what	1
had	1
come	1
of	1
it!	1
And	1
it	1
suddenly	1
sprang	1
into	1
James’s	1
mind	1
that	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
for	1
himself.	1
In	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
that	1
fog	1
of	1
uneasiness	1
in	1
which	1
his	1
mind	1
was	1
enveloped	1
the	1
notion	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
go	1
and	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
house	1
afforded	1
him	1
inexplicable	1
satisfaction.	1
It	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
simply	1
the	1
decision	1
to	1
do	1
something	1
—	1
more	1
possibly	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
a	1
house	1
—	1
that	1
gave	1
him	1
relief.	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
in	1
staring	1
at	1
an	1
edifice	1
of	1
bricks	1
and	1
mortar,	1
of	1
wood	1
and	1
stone,	1
built	1
by	1
the	1
suspected	1
man	1
himself,	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
looking	1
into	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
that	1
rumour	1
about	1
Irene.	1
Without	1
saying	1
a	1
word,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
anyone,	1
he	1
took	1
a	1
hansom	1
to	1
the	1
station	1
and	1
proceeded	1
by	1
train	1
to	1
Robin	1
Hill;	1
thence	1
—	1
there	1
being	1
no	1
‘flies,’	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
the	1
custom	1
of	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
—	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
obliged	1
to	1
walk.	1
He	1
started	1
slowly	1
up	1
the	1
hill,	1
his	1
angular	1
knees	1
and	1
high	1
shoulders	1
bent	1
complainingly,	1
his	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
his	1
feet,	1
yet,	1
neat	1
for	1
all	1
that,	1
in	1
his	1
high	1
hat	1
and	1
his	1
frock-coat,	1
on	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
speckless	1
gloss	1
imparted	1
by	1
perfect	1
superintendence.	1
Emily	1
saw	1
to	1
that;	1
that	1
is,	1
she	1
did	1
not,	1
of	1
course,	1
see	1
to	1
it	1
—	1
people	1
of	1
good	1
position	1
not	1
seeing	1
to	1
each	1
other’s	1
buttons,	1
and	1
Emily	1
was	1
of	1
good	1
position	1
—	1
but	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
butler	1
saw	1
to	1
it.	1
He	1
had	1
to	1
ask	1
his	1
way	1
three	1
times;	1
on	1
each	1
occasion	1
he	1
repeated	1
the	1
directions	1
given	1
him,	1
got	1
the	1
man	1
to	1
repeat	1
them,	1
then	1
repeated	1
them	1
a	1
second	1
time,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
naturally	1
of	1
a	1
talkative	1
disposition,	1
and	1
one	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
too	1
careful	1
in	1
a	1
new	1
neighbourhood.	1
He	1
kept	1
assuring	1
them	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
new	1
house	1
he	1
was	1
looking	1
for;	1
it	1
was	1
only,	1
however,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
shown	1
the	1
roof	1
through	1
the	1
trees	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
feel	1
really	1
satisfied	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
directed	1
entirely	1
wrong.	1
A	1
heavy	1
sky	1
seemed	1
to	1
cover	1
the	1
world	1
with	1
the	1
grey	1
whiteness	1
of	1
a	1
whitewashed	1
ceiling.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
freshness	1
or	1
fragrance	1
in	1
the	1
air.	1
On	1
such	1
a	1
day	1
even	1
British	1
workmen	1
scarcely	1
cared	1
to	1
do	1
more	1
then	1
they	1
were	1
obliged,	1
and	1
moved	1
about	1
their	1
business	1
without	1
the	1
drone	1
of	1
talk	1
which	1
whiles	1
away	1
the	1
pangs	1
of	1
labour.	1
Through	1
spaces	1
of	1
the	1
unfinished	1
house,	1
shirt-sleeved	1
figures	1
worked	1
slowly,	1
and	1
sounds	1
arose	1
—	1
spasmodic	1
knockings,	1
the	1
scraping	1
of	1
metal,	1
the	1
sawing	1
of	1
wood,	1
with	1
the	1
rumble	1
of	1
wheelbarrows	1
along	1
boards;	1
now	1
and	1
again	1
the	1
foreman’s	1
dog,	1
tethered	1
by	1
a	1
string	1
to	1
an	1
oaken	1
beam,	1
whimpered	1
feebly,	1
with	1
a	1
sound	1
like	1
the	1
singing	1
of	1
a	1
kettle.	1
The	1
fresh-fitted	1
window-panes,	1
daubed	1
each	1
with	1
a	1
white	1
patch	1
in	1
the	1
centre,	1
stared	1
out	1
at	1
James	1
like	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
a	1
blind	1
dog.	1
And	1
the	1
building	1
chorus	1
went	1
on,	1
strident	1
and	1
mirthless	1
under	1
the	1
grey-white	1
sky.	1
But	1
the	1
thrushes,	1
hunting	1
amongst	1
the	1
fresh-turned	1
earth	1
for	1
worms,	1
were	1
silent	1
quite.	1
James	1
picked	1
his	1
way	1
among	1
the	1
heaps	1
of	1
gravel	1
—	1
the	1
drive	1
was	1
being	1
laid	1
—	1
till	1
he	1
came	1
opposite	1
the	1
porch.	1
Here	1
he	1
stopped	1
and	1
raised	1
his	1
eyes.	1
There	1
was	1
but	1
little	1
to	1
see	1
from	1
this	1
point	1
of	1
view,	1
and	1
that	1
little	1
he	1
took	1
in	1
at	1
once;	1
but	1
he	1
stayed	1
in	1
this	1
position	1
many	1
minutes,	1
and	1
who	1
shall	1
know	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
thought.	1
His	1
china-blue	1
eyes	1
under	1
white	1
eyebrows	1
that	1
jutted	1
out	1
in	1
little	1
horns,	1
never	1
stirred;	1
the	1
long	1
upper	1
lip	1
of	1
his	1
wide	1
mouth,	1
between	1
the	1
fine	1
white	1
whiskers,	1
twitched	1
once	1
or	1
twice;	1
it	1
was	1
easy	1
to	1
see	1
from	1
that	1
anxious	1
rapt	1
expression,	1
whence	1
Soames	1
derived	1
the	1
handicapped	1
look	1
which	1
sometimes	1
came	1
upon	1
his	1
face.	1
James	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
saying	1
to	1
himself:	1
‘I	1
don’t	1
know	1
—	1
life’s	1
a	1
tough	1
job.’	1
In	1
this	1
position	1
Bosinney	1
surprised	1
him.	1
James	1
brought	1
his	1
eyes	1
down	1
from	1
whatever	1
bird’s-nest	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
looking	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
sky	1
to	1
Bosinney’s	1
face,	1
on	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
humorous	1
scorn.	1
“How	1
do	1
you	1
do,	1
Mr.	1
Forsyte?	1
Come	1
down	1
to	1
see	1
for	1
yourself?”	1
It	1
was	1
exactly	1
what	1
James,	1
as	1
we	1
know,	1
had	1
come	1
for,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
made	1
correspondingly	1
uneasy.	1
He	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
hand,	1
however,	1
saying:	1
“How	1
are	1
you?”	1
without	1
looking	1
at	1
Bosinney.	1
The	1
latter	1
made	1
way	1
for	1
him	1
with	1
an	1
ironical	1
smile.	1
James	1
scented	1
something	1
suspicious	1
in	1
this	1
courtesy.	1
“I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
walk	1
round	1
the	1
outside	1
first,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“and	1
see	1
what	1
you’ve	1
been	1
doing!”	1
A	1
flagged	1
terrace	1
of	1
rounded	1
stones	1
with	1
a	1
list	1
of	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
inches	1
to	1
port	1
had	1
been	1
laid	1
round	1
the	1
south-east	1
and	1
south-west	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
ran	1
with	1
a	1
bevelled	1
edge	1
into	1
mould,	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
preparation	1
for	1
being	1
turfed;	1
along	1
this	1
terrace	1
James	1
led	1
the	1
way.	1
“Now	1
what	1
did	1
this	1
cost?”	1
he	1
asked,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
terrace	1
extending	1
round	1
the	1
corner.	1
“What	1
should	1
you	1
think?”	1
inquired	1
Bosinney.	1
“How	1
should	1
I	1
know?”	1
replied	1
James	1
somewhat	1
nonplussed;	1
“two	1
or	1
three	1
hundred,	1
I	1
dare	1
say!”	1
“The	1
exact	1
sum!”	1
James	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
sharp	1
look,	1
but	1
the	1
architect	1
appeared	1
unconscious,	1
and	1
he	1
put	1
the	1
answer	1
down	1
to	1
mishearing.	1
On	1
arriving	1
at	1
the	1
garden	1
entrance,	1
he	1
stopped	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
view.	1
“That	1
ought	1
to	1
come	1
down,”	1
he	1
said,	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
oak-tree.	1
“You	1
think	1
so?	1
You	1
think	1
that	1
with	1
the	1
tree	1
there	1
you	1
don’t	1
get	1
enough	1
view	1
for	1
your	1
money.”	1
Again	1
James	1
eyed	1
him	1
suspiciously	1
—	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
had	1
a	1
peculiar	1
way	1
of	1
putting	1
things:	1
“Well!”	1
he	1
said,	1
with	1
a	1
perplexed,	1
nervous,	1
emphasis,	1
“I	1
don’t	1
see	1
what	1
you	1
want	1
with	1
a	1
tree.”	1
“It	1
shall	1
come	1
down	1
to-morrow,”	1
said	1
Bosinney.	1
James	1
was	1
alarmed.	1
“Oh,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“don’t	1
go	1
saying	1
I	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
come	1
down!	1
I	1
know	1
nothing	1
about	1
it!”	1
“No?”	1
James	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
a	1
fluster:	1
“Why,	1
what	1
should	1
I	1
know	1
about	1
it?	1
It’s	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
me!	1
You	1
do	1
it	1
on	1
your	1
own	1
responsibility.”	1
“You’ll	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
mention	1
your	1
name?”	1
James	1
grew	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
alarmed:	1
“I	1
don’t	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
want	1
mentioning	1
my	1
name	1
for,”	1
he	1
muttered;	1
“you’d	1
better	1
leave	1
the	1
tree	1
alone.	1
It’s	1
not	1
your	1
tree!”	1
He	1
took	1
out	1
a	1
silk	1
handkerchief	1
and	1
wiped	1
his	1
brow.	1
They	1
entered	1
the	1
house.	1
Like	1
Swithin,	1
James	1
was	1
impressed	1
by	1
the	1
inner	1
court-yard.	1
“You	1
must	1
have	1
spent	1
a	1
douce	1
of	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
money	1
here,”	1
he	1
said,	1
after	1
staring	1
at	1
the	1
columns	1
and	1
gallery	1
for	1
some	1
time.	1
“Now,	1
what	1
did	1
it	1
cost	1
to	1
put	1
up	1
those	1
columns?”	1
“I	1
can’t	1
tell	1
you	1
off-hand,”	1
thoughtfully	1
answered	1
Bosinney,	1
“but	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
deuce	1
of	1
a	1
lot!”	1
“I	1
should	1
think	1
so,”	1
said	1
James.	1
“I	1
should.	1
.	3
”	1
He	1
caught	1
the	1
architect’s	1
eye,	1
and	1
broke	1
off.	1
And	1
now,	1
whenever	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
anything	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
desired	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
cost,	1
he	1
stifled	1
that	1
curiosity.	1
Bosinney	1
appeared	1
determined	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
see	1
everything,	1
and	1
had	1
not	1
James	1
been	1
of	1
too	1
‘noticing’	1
a	1
nature,	1
he	1
would	1
certainly	1
have	1
found	1
himself	1
going	1
round	1
the	1
house	1
a	1
second	1
time.	1
He	1
seemed	1
so	1
anxious	1
to	1
be	1
asked	1
questions,	1
too,	1
that	1
James	1
felt	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
on	1
his	1
guard.	1
He	1
began	1
to	1
suffer	1
from	1
his	1
exertions,	1
for,	1
though	1
wiry	1
enough	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
his	1
long	1
build,	1
he	1
was	1
seventy-five	1
years	1
old.	1
He	1
grew	1
discouraged;	1
he	1
seemed	1
no	1
nearer	1
to	1
anything,	1
had	1
not	1
obtained	1
from	1
his	1
inspection	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
knowledge	1
he	1
had	1
vaguely	1
hoped	1
for.	1
He	1
had	1
merely	1
increased	1
his	1
dislike	1
and	1
mistrust	1
of	1
this	1
young	1
man,	1
who	1
had	1
tired	1
him	1
out	1
with	1
his	1
politeness,	1
and	1
in	1
whose	1
manner	1
he	1
now	1
certainly	1
detected	1
mockery.	1
The	1
fellow	1
was	1
sharper	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
thought,	1
and	1
better-looking	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
hoped.	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
—	1
a	1
‘don’t	1
care’	1
appearance	1
that	1
James,	1
to	1
whom	1
risk	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
intolerable	1
thing	1
in	1
life,	1
did	1
not	1
appreciate;	1
a	1
peculiar	1
smile,	1
too,	1
coming	1
when	1
least	1
expected;	1
and	1
very	1
queer	1
eyes.	1
He	1
reminded	1
James,	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
afterwards,	1
of	1
a	1
hungry	1
cat.	1
This	1
was	1
as	1
near	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
get,	1
in	1
conversation	1
with	1
Emily,	1
to	1
a	1
description	1
of	1
the	1
peculiar	1
exasperation,	1
velvetiness,	1
and	1
mockery,	1
of	1
which	1
Bosinney’s	1
manner	1
had	1
been	1
composed.	1
At	1
last,	1
having	1
seen	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
seen,	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
again	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
in;	1
and	1
now,	1
feeling	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
wasting	1
time	1
and	1
strength	1
and	1
money,	1
all	1
for	1
nothing,	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
courage	1
of	1
a	1
Forsyte	1
in	1
both	1
hands,	1
and,	1
looking	1
sharply	1
at	1
Bosinney,	1
said:	1
“I	1
dare	1
say	1
you	1
see	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
of	1
my	1
daughter-in-law;	1
now,	1
what	1
does	1
she	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
house?	1
But	1
she	1
hasn’t	1
seen	1
it,	1
I	1
suppose?”	1
This	1
he	1
said,	1
knowing	1
all	1
about	1
Irene’s	1
visit	1
not,	1
of	1
course,	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
anything	1
in	1
the	1
visit,	1
except	1
that	1
extraordinary	1
remark	1
she	1
had	1
made	1
about	1
‘not	1
caring	1
to	1
get	1
home’—	1
and	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
how	1
June	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
news!	1
He	1
had	1
determined,	1
by	1
this	1
way	1
of	1
putting	1
the	1
question,	1
to	1
give	1
Bosinney	1
a	1
chance,	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself.	1
The	1
latter	1
was	1
long	1
in	1
answering,	1
but	1
kept	1
his	1
eyes	1
with	1
uncomfortable	1
steadiness	1
on	1
James.	1
“She	1
has	1
seen	1
the	1
house,	1
but	1
I	1
can’t	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
she	1
thinks	1
of	1
it.”	1
Nervous	1
and	1
baffled,	1
James	1
was	1
constitutionally	1
prevented	1
from	1
letting	1
the	1
matter	1
drop.	1
“Oh!”	1
he	1
said,	1
“she	1
has	1
seen	1
it?	1
Soames	1
brought	1
her	1
down,	1
I	1
suppose?”	1
Bosinney	1
smilingly	1
replied:	1
“Oh,	1
no!”	1
“What,	1
did	1
she	1
come	1
down	1
alone?”	1
“Oh,	1
no!”	1
“Then	1
—	1
who	1
brought	1
her?”	1
“I	1
really	1
don’t	1
know	1
whether	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
who	1
brought	1
her.”	1
To	1
James,	1
who	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
Swithin,	1
this	1
answer	1
appeared	1
incomprehensible.	1
“Why!”	1
he	1
stammered,	1
“you	1
know	1
that.	1
.	3
”	1
but	1
he	1
stopped,	1
suddenly	1
perceiving	1
his	1
danger.	1
“Well,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“if	1
you	1
don’t	1
want	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
I	1
suppose	1
you	1
won’t!	1
Nobody	1
tells	1
me	1
anything.”	1
Somewhat	1
to	1
his	1
surprise	1
Bosinney	1
asked	1
him	1
a	1
question.	1
“By	1
the	1
by,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“could	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
if	1
there	1
are	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
any	1
more	1
of	1
you	1
coming	1
down?	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
spot!”	1
“Any	1
more?”	1
said	1
James	1
bewildered,	1
“who	1
should	1
there	1
be	1
more?	1
I	1
don’t	1
know	1
of	1
any	1
more.	1
Good-bye?”	1
Looking	1
at	1
the	1
ground	1
he	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
hand,	1
crossed	1
the	1
palm	1
of	1
it	1
with	1
Bosinney’s,	1
and	1
taking	1
his	1
umbrella	1
just	1
above	1
the	1
silk,	1
walked	1
away	1
along	1
the	1
terrace.	1
Before	1
he	1
turned	1
the	1
corner	1
he	1
glanced	1
back,	1
and	1
saw	1
Bosinney	1
following	1
him	1
slowly	1
—‘slinking	1
along	1
the	1
wall’	1
as	1
he	1
put	1
it	1
to	1
himself,	1
‘like	1
a	1
great	1
cat.’	1
He	1
paid	1
no	1
attention	1
when	1
the	1
young	1
fellow	1
raised	1
his	1
hat.	1
Outside	1
the	1
drive,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
sight,	1
he	1
slackened	1
his	1
pace	1
still	1
more.	1
Very	1
slowly,	1
more	1
bent	1
than	1
when	1
he	1
came,	1
lean,	1
hungry,	1
and	1
disheartened,	1
he	1
made	1
his	1
way	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
station.	1
The	1
Buccaneer,	1
watching	1
him	1
go	1
so	1
sadly	1
home,	1
felt	1
sorry	1
perhaps	1
for	1
his	1
behaviour	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
man.	1
Chapter	1

Soames	1
and	1
Bosinney	1
Correspond	1
James	1
said	1
nothing	1
to	1
his	1
son	1
of	1
this	1
visit	1
to	1
the	1
house;	1
but,	1
having	1
occasion	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Timothy’s	1
on	1
morning	1
on	1
a	1
matter	1
connected	1
with	1
a	1
drainage	1
scheme	1
which	1
was	1
being	1
forced	1
by	1
the	1
sanitary	1
authorities	1
on	1
his	1
brother,	1
he	1
mentioned	1
it	1
there.	1
It	1
was	1
not,	1
he	1
said,	1
a	1
bad	1
house.	1
He	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
could	1
be	1
made	1
of	1
it.	1
The	1
fellow	1
was	1
clever	1
in	1
his	1
way,	1
though	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
cost	1
Soames	1
before	1
it	1
was	1
done	1
with	1
he	1
didn’t	1
know.	1
Euphemia	1
Forsyte,	1
who	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
—	1
she	1
had	1
come	1
round	1
to	1
borrow	1
the	1
Rev.	1
Mr.	1
Scoles’	1
last	1
novel,	1
‘Passion	1
and	1
Paregoric’,	1
which	1
was	1
having	1
such	1
a	1
vogue	1
—	1
chimed	1
in.	1
“I	1
saw	1
Irene	1
yesterday	1
at	1
the	1
Stores;	1
she	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Bosinney	1
were	1
having	1
a	1
nice	1
little	1
chat	1
in	1
the	1
Groceries.”	1
It	1
was	1
thus,	1
simply,	1
that	1
she	1
recorded	1
a	1
scene	1
which	1
had	1
really	1
made	1
a	1
deep	1
and	1
complicated	1
impression	1
on	1
her.	1
She	1
had	1
been	1
hurrying	1
to	1
the	1
silk	1
department	1
of	1
the	1
Church	1
and	1
Commercial	1
Stores	1
—	1
that	1
Institution	1
than	1
which,	1
with	1
its	1
admirable	1
system,	1
admitting	1
only	1
guaranteed	1
persons	1
on	1
a	1
basis	1
of	1
payment	1
before	1
delivery,	1
no	1
emporium	1
can	1
be	1
more	1
highly	1
recommended	1
to	1
Forsytes	1
—	1
to	1
match	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
prunella	1
silk	1
for	1
her	1
mother,	1
who	1
was	1
waiting	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
outside.	1
Passing	1
through	1
the	1
Groceries	1
her	1
eye	1
was	1
unpleasantly	1
attracted	1
by	1
the	1
back	1
view	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
beautiful	1
figure.	1
It	1
was	1
so	1
charmingly	1
proportioned,	1
so	1
balanced,	1
and	1
so	1
well	1
clothed,	1
that	1
Euphemia’s	1
instinctive	1
propriety	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
alarmed;	1
such	1
figures,	1
she	1
knew,	1
by	1
intuition	1
rather	1
than	1
experience,	1
were	1
rarely	1
connected	1
with	1
virtue	1
—	1
certainly	1
never	1
in	1
her	1
mind,	1
for	1
her	1
own	1
back	1
was	1
somewhat	1
difficult	1
to	1
fit.	1
Her	1
suspicions	1
were	1
fortunately	1
confirmed.	1
A	1
young	1
man	1
coming	1
from	1
the	1
Drugs	1
had	1
snatched	1
off	1
his	1
hat,	1
and	1
was	1
accosting	1
the	1
lady	1
with	1
the	1
unknown	1
back.	1
It	1
was	1
then	1
that	1
she	1
saw	1
with	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
deal;	1
the	1
lady	1
was	1
undoubtedly	1
Mrs.	1
Soames,	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
Mr.	1
Bosinney.	1
Concealing	1
herself	1
rapidly	1
over	1
the	1
purchase	1
of	1
a	1
box	1
of	1
Tunisian	1
dates,	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
impatient	1
of	1
awkwardly	1
meeting	1
people	1
with	1
parcels	1
in	1
her	1
hands,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
busy	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
morning,	1
she	1
was	1
quite	1
unintentionally	1
an	1
interested	1
observer	1
of	1
their	1
little	1
interview.	1
Mrs.	1
Soames,	1
usually	1
somewhat	1
pale,	1
had	1
a	1
delightful	1
colour	1
in	1
her	1
cheeks;	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Bosinney’s	1
manner	1
was	1
strange,	1
though	1
attractive	1
(she	1
thought	1
him	1
rather	1
a	1
distinguished-looking	1
man,	1
and	1
George’s	1
name	1
for	1
him,	1
‘The	1
Buccaneer’—	1
about	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
romantic	1
—	1
quite	1
charming).	1
He	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
pleading.	1
Indeed,	1
they	1
talked	1
so	1
earnestly	1
—	1
or,	1
rather,	1
he	1
talked	1
so	1
earnestly,	1
for	1
Mrs.	1
Soames	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
much	1
—	1
that	1
they	1
caused,	1
inconsiderately,	1
an	1
eddy	1
in	1
the	1
traffic.	1
One	1
nice	1
old	1
General,	1
going	1
towards	1
Cigars,	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
step	1
quite	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
chancing	1
to	1
look	1
up	1
and	1
see	1
Mrs.	1
Soames’	1
face,	1
he	1
actually	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
hat,	1
the	1
old	1
fool!	1
So	1
like	1
a	1
man!	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
Mrs.	1
Soames’	1
eyes	1
that	1
worried	1
Euphemia.	1
She	1
never	1
once	1
looked	1
at	1
Mr.	1
Bosinney	1
until	1
he	1
moved	1
on,	1
and	1
then	1
she	1
looked	1
after	1
him.	1
And,	1
oh,	1
that	1
look!	1
On	1
that	1
look	1
Euphemia	1
had	1
spent	1
much	1
anxious	1
thought.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
too	1
much	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
hurt	1
her	1
with	1
its	1
dark,	1
lingering	1
softness,	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
as	1
though	1
the	1
woman	1
wanted	1
to	1
drag	1
him	1
back,	1
and	1
unsay	1
something	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
saying.	1
Ah,	1
well,	1
she	1
had	2
no	1
time	1
to	1
go	1
deeply	1
into	1
the	1
matter	1
just	1
then,	1
with	1
that	1
prunella	1
silk	1
on	1
her	1
hands;	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
‘very	1
intriguee’—	1
very!	1
She	1
had	1
just	1
nodded	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Soames,	1
to	1
show	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
seen;	1
and,	1
as	1
she	1
confided,	1
in	1
talking	1
it	1
over	1
afterwards,	1
to	1
her	1
chum	1
Francie	1
(Roger’s	1
daughter),	1
“Didn’t	1
she	1
look	1
caught	1
out	1
just?	1
.	4
”	1
James,	1
most	1
averse	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
blush	1
to	1
accepting	1
any	1
news	1
confirmatory	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
poignant	1
suspicions,	1
took	1
her	1
up	1
at	1
once.	1
“Oh”	1
he	1
said,	1
“they’d	1
be	1
after	1
wall-papers	1
no	1
doubt.”	1
Euphemia	1
smiled.	1
“In	1
the	1
Groceries?”	1
she	1
said	1
softly;	1
and,	1
taking	1
‘Passion	1
and	1
Paregoric’	1
from	1
the	1
table,	1
added:	1
“And	1
so	1
you’ll	1
lend	1
me	1
this,	1
dear	1
Auntie?	1
Good-bye!”	1
and	1
went	1
away.	1
James	1
left	1
almost	1
immediately	1
after;	1
he	1
was	1
late	1
as	1
it	1
was.	1
When	1
he	1
reached	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
Forsyte,	1
Bustard	1
and	1
Forsyte,	1
he	1
found	1
Soames,	1
sitting	1
in	1
his	1
revolving,	1
chair,	1
drawing	1
up	1
a	1
defence.	1
The	1
latter	1
greeted	1
his	1
father	1
with	1
a	1
curt	1
good-morning,	1
and,	1
taking	1
an	1
envelope	1
from	1
his	1
pocket,	1
said:	1
“It	1
may	1
interest	1
you	1
to	1
look	1
through	1
this.”	1
James	1
read	1
as	1
follows:	1
309D,	1
SLOANE	1
STREET,	1
May	1
15.	1
‘DEAR	1
FORSYTE,	1
‘The	1
construction	1
of	1
your	1
house	1
being	1
now	1
completed,	1
my	1
duties	1
as	1
architect	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
an	1
end.	1
If	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
with	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
decoration,	1
which	1
at	1
your	1
request	1
I	1
undertook,	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
you	1
to	1
clearly	1
understand	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
free	1
hand.	1
‘You	1
never	1
come	1
down	1
without	1
suggesting	1
something	1
that	1
goes	1
counter	1
to	1
my	1

I	1
have	1
here	1
three	1
letters	1
from	1
you,	1
each	1
of	1
which	1
recommends	1
an	1

I	1
should	1
never	1

in.	1
I	1
had	1
your	1
father	1
here	1
yesterday	1
afternoon,	1
who	1
made	1
further	1
valuable	1
suggestions.	1
‘Please	1

therefore,	1
whether	1
you	1
want	1
me	1
to	1
decorate	1
for	1
you,	1
or	1
to	1
retire	1
which	1
on	1
the	1
whole	1
I	1
should	1
prefer	1
to	1
do.	1
‘But	1
understand	1
that,	1
if	1
I	1
decorate,	1
I	1
decorate	1
alone,	1
without	1
interference	1
of	1
any	1
sort.	1
If	1
I	1
do	1
the	1
thing,	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
it	1
thoroughly,	1
but	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
free	1
hand.	1
‘Yours	1
truly,	1
‘PHILIP	1
BOSINNEY.’	1
The	1
exact	1
and	1
immediate	1
cause	1
of	1
this	1
letter	1
cannot,	1
of	1
course,	1
be	1
told,	1
though	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
improbable	1
that	1
Bosinney	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
moved	1
by	1
some	1
sudden	1
revolt	1
against	1
his	1
position	1
towards	1
Soames	1
—	1
that	1
eternal	1
position	1
of	1
Art	1
towards	1
Property	1
—	1
which	1
is	1
so	1
admirably	1
summed	1
up,	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
indispensable	1
of	1
modern	1
appliances,	1
in	1
a	1
sentence	1
comparable	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
finest	1
in	1
Tacitus:	1
THOS.	1
T.	1
SORROW,	1
Inventor.	1
BERT	1
M.	1
PADLAND,	1
Proprietor.	1
“What	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
him?”	1
James	1
asked.	1
Soames	1
did	1
not	1
even	1
turn	1
his	1
head.	1
“I	1
haven’t	1
made	1
up	1
my	1
mind,”	1
he	1
said,	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
defence.	1
A	1
client	1
of	1
his,	1
having	1
put	1
some	1
buildings	1
on	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
ground	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
belong	1
to	1
him,	1
had	1
been	1
suddenly	1
and	1
most	1
irritatingly	1
warned	1
to	1
take	1
them	1
off	1
again.	1
After	1
carefully	1
going	1
into	1
the	1
facts,	1
however,	1
Soames	1
had	1
seen	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
advise	1
that	1
his	1
client	1
had	1
what	1
was	1
known	1
as	1
a	1
title	1
by	1
possession,	1
and	1
that,	1
though	1
undoubtedly	1
the	1
ground	1
did	1
not	1
belong	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
was	1
entitled	1
to	1
keep	1
it,	1
and	1
had	1
better	1
do	1
so;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
following	1
up	1
this	1
advice	1
by	1
taking	1
steps	1
to	1
—	1
as	1
the	1
sailors	1
say	1
—‘make	1
it	1
so.’	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
distinct	1
reputation	1
for	1
sound	1
advice;	1
people	1
saying	1
of	1
him:	1
“Go	1
to	1
young	1
Forsyte	1
—	1
a	1
long-headed	1
fellow!”	1
and	1
he	1
prized	1
this	1
reputation	1
highly.	1
His	1
natural	1
taciturnity	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
favour;	1
nothing	1
could	1
be	1
more	1
calculated	1
to	1
give	1
people,	1
especially	1
people	1
with	1
property	1
(Soames	1
had	1
no	1
other	1
clients),	1
the	1
impression	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
safe	1
man.	1
And	1
he	1
was	1
safe.	1
Tradition,	1
habit,	1
education,	1
inherited	1
aptitude,	1
native	1
caution,	1
all	1
joined	1
to	1
form	1
a	1
solid	1
professional	1
honesty,	1
superior	1
to	1
temptation	1
—	1
from	1
the	1
very	1
fact	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
built	1
on	1
an	1
innate	1
avoidance	1
of	1
risk.	1
How	1
could	1
he	1
fall,	1
when	1
his	1
soul	1
abhorred	1
circumstances	1
which	1
render	1
a	1
fall	1
possible	1
—	1
a	1
man	1
cannot	1
fall	1
off	1
the	1
floor!	1
And	1
those	1
countless	1
Forsytes,	1
who,	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
innumerable	1
transactions	1
concerned	1
with	1
property	1
of	1
all	1
sorts	1
(from	1
wives	1
to	1
water	1
rights),	1
had	1
occasion	1
for	1
the	1
services	1
of	1
a	1
safe	1
man,	1
found	1
it	1
both	1
reposeful	1
and	1
profitable	1
to	1
confide	1
in	1
Soames.	1
That	1
slight	1
superciliousness	1
of	1
his,	1
combined	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
mousing	1
amongst	1
precedents,	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
favour	1
too	1
—	1
a	1
man	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
supercilious	1
unless	1
he	1
knew!	1
He	1
was	1
really	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
business,	1
for	1
though	1
James	1
still	1
came	1
nearly	1
every	1
day	1
to,	1
see	1
for	1
himself,	1
he	1
did	1
little	1
now	1
but	1
sit	1
in	1
his	1
chair,	1
twist	1
his	1
legs,	1
slightly	1
confuse	1
things	1
already	1
decided,	1
and	1
presently	1
go	1
away	1
again,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
partner,	1
Bustard,	1
was	1
a	1
poor	1
thing,	1
who	1
did	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
work,	1
but	1
whose	1
opinion	1
was	1
never	1
taken.	1
So	1
Soames	1
went	1
steadily	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
defence.	1
Yet	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
idle	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
his	1
mind	1
was	1
at	1
ease.	1
He	1
was	1
suffering	1
from	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
impending	1
trouble,	1
that	1
had	1
haunted	1
him	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
past.	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
think	1
it	1
physical	1
—	1
a	1
condition	1
of	1
his	1
liver	1
—	1
but	1
knew	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not.	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
watch.	1
In	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
he	1
was	1
due	1
at	1
the	1
General	1
Meeting	1
of	1
the	1
New	1
Colliery	1
Company	1
—	1
one	1
of	1
Uncle	1
Jolyon’s	1
concerns;	1
he	1
should	1
see	1
Uncle	1
Jolyon	1
there,	1
and	1
say	1
something	1
to	1
him	1
about	1
Bosinney	1
—	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
what,	1
but	1
something	1
—	1
in	1
any	1
case	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
answer	1
this	1
letter	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
Uncle	1
Jolyon.	1
He	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
methodically	1
put	1
away	1
the	1
draft	1
of	1
his	1
defence.	1
Going	1
into	1
a	1
dark	1
little	1
cupboard,	1
he	1
turned	1
up	1
the	1
light,	1
washed	1
his	1
hands	1
with	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
brown	1
Windsor	1
soap,	1
and	1
dried	1
them	1
on	1
a	1
roller	1
towel.	1
Then	1
he	1
brushed	1
his	1
hair,	1
paying	1
strict	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
parting,	1
turned	1
down	1
the	1
light,	1
took	1
his	1
hat,	1
and	1
saying	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
back	1
at	1
half-past	1
two,	1
stepped	1
into	1
the	1
Poultry.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
far	1
to	1
the	1
Offices	1
of	1
the	1
New	1
Colliery	1
Company	1
in	1
Ironmonger	1
Lane,	1
where,	1
and	1
not	1
at	1
the	1
Cannon	1
Street	1
Hotel,	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
the	1
more	1
ambitious	1
practice	1
of	1
other	1
companies,	1
the	1
General	1
Meeting	1
was	1
always	1
held.	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
had	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
set	1
his	1
face	1
against	1
the	1
Press.	1
What	1
business	1
—	1
he	1
said	1
—	1
had	1
the	1
Public	1
with	1
his	1
concerns!	1
Soames	1
arrived	1
on	1
the	1
stroke	1
of	1
time,	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
seat	1
alongside	1
the	1
Board,	1
who,	1
in	1
a	1
row,	1
each	1
Director	1
behind	1
his	1
own	1
ink-pot,	1
faced	1
their	1
Shareholders.	1
In	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
this	1
row	1
old	1
Jolyon,	1
conspicuous	1
in	1
his	1
black,	1
tightly-buttoned	1
frock-coat	1
and	1
his	1
white	1
moustaches,	1
was	1
leaning	1
back	1
with	1
finger	1
tips	1
crossed	1
on	1
a	1
copy	1
of	1
the	1
Directors’	1
report	1
and	1
accounts.	1
On	1
his	1
right	1
hand,	1
always	1
a	1
little	1
larger	1
than	1
life,	1
sat	1
the	1
Secretary,	1
‘Down-by-the-starn’	1
Hemmings;	1
an	1
all-too-sad	1
sadness	1
beaming	1
in	1
his	1
fine	1
eyes;	1
his	1
iron-grey	1
beard,	1
in	1
mourning	1
like	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
him,	1
giving	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
an	1
all-too-black	1
tie	1
behind	1
it.	1
The	1
occasion	1
indeed	1
was	1
a	1
melancholy	1
one,	1
only	1
six	1
weeks	1
having	1
elapsed	1
since	1
that	1
telegram	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
Scorrier,	1
the	1
mining	1
expert,	1
on	1
a	1
private	1
mission	1
to	1
the	1
Mines,	1
informing	1
them	1
that	1
Pippin,	1
their	1
Superintendent,	1
had	1
committed	1
suicide	1
in	1
endeavouring,	1
after	1
his	1
extraordinary	1
two	1
years’	1
silence,	1
to	1
write	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
his	1
Board.	1
That	1
letter	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
now;	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
read	1
to	1
the	1
Shareholders,	1
who	1
would	1
of	1
course	1
be	1
put	1
into	1
possession	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
facts.	1
Hemmings	1
had	1
often	1
said	1
to	1
Soames,	1
standing	1
with	1
his	1
coat-tails	1
divided	1
before	1
the	1
fireplace:	1
“What	1
our	1
Shareholders	1
don’t	1
know	1
about	1
our	1
affairs	1
isn’t	1
worth	1
knowing.	1
You	1
may	1
take	1
that	1
from	1
me,	1
Mr.	1
Soames.”	1
On	1
one	1
occasion,	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
being	1
present,	1
Soames	1
recollected	1
a	1
little	1
unpleasantness.	1
His	1
uncle	1
had	1
looked	1
up	1
sharply	1
and	1
said:	1
“Don’t	1
talk	1
nonsense,	1
Hemmings!	1
You	1
mean	1
that	1
what	1
they	1
do	1
know	1
isn’t	1
worth	1
knowing!”	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
detested	1
humbug.	1
Hemmings,	1
angry-eyed,	1
and	1
wearing	1
a	1
smile	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
trained	1
poodle,	1
had	1
replied	1
in	1
an	1
outburst	1
of	1
artificial	1
applause:	1
“Come,	1
now,	1
that’s	1
good,	1
sir	1
—	1
that’s	1
very	1
good.	1
Your	1
uncle	1
will	1
have	1
his	1
joke!”	1
The	1
next	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
Soames	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
opportunity	1
of	1
saying	1
to	1
him:	1
“The	1
chairman’s	1
getting	1
very	1
old!	1
—	1
I	1
can’t	1
get	1
him	1
to	1
understand	1
things;	1
and	1
he’s	1
so	1
wilful	1
—	1
but	1
what	1
can	1
you	1
expect,	1
with	1
a	1
chin	1
like	1
his?”	1
Soames	1
had	1
nodded.	1
Everyone	1
knew	1
that	1
Uncle	1
Jolyon’s	1
chin	1
was	1
a	1
caution.	1
He	1
was	1
looking	1
worried	1
to-day,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
General	1
Meeting	1
look;	1
he	1
(Soames)	1
should	1
certainly	1
speak	1
to	1
him	1
about	1
Bosinney.	1
Beyond	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
was	1
little	1
Mr.	1
Booker,	1
and	1
he,	1
too,	1
wore	1
his	1
General	1
Meeting	1
look,	1
as	1
though	1
searching	1
for	1
some	1
particularly	1
tender	1
shareholder.	1
And	1
next	1
him	1
was	1
the	1
deaf	1
director,	1
with	1
a	1
frown;	1
and	1
beyond	1
the	1
deaf	1
director,	1
again,	1
was	1
old	1
Mr.	1
Bleedham,	1
very	1
bland,	1
and	1
having	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
conscious	1
virtue	1
—	1
as	1
well	1
he	1
might,	1
knowing	1
that	1
the	1
brown-paper	1
parcel	1
he	1
always	1
brought	1
to	1
the	1
Board-room	1
was	1
concealed	1
behind	1
his	1
hat	1
(one	1
of	1
that	1
old-fashioned	1
class,	1
of	1
flat-brimmed	1
top-hats	1
which	1
go	1
with	1
very	1
large	1
bow	1
ties,	1
clean-shaven	1
lips,	1
fresh	1
cheeks,	1
and	1
neat	1
little,	1
white	1
whiskers).	1
Soames	1
always	1
attended	1
the	1
General	1
Meeting;	1
it	1
was	1
considered	1
better	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
do	1
so,	1
in	1
case	1
‘anything	1
should	1
arise!’	1
He	1
glanced	1
round	1
with	1
his	1
close,	1
supercilious	1
air	1
at	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
where	1
hung	1
plans	1
of	1
the	1
mine	1
and	1
harbour,	1
together	1
with	1
a	1
large	1
photograph	1
of	1
a	1
shaft	1
leading	1
to	1
a	1
working	1
which	1
had	1
proved	1
quite	1
remarkably	1
unprofitable.	1
This	1
photograph	1
—	1
a	1
witness	1
to	1
the	1
eternal	1
irony	1
underlying	1
commercial	1
enterprise	1
till	1
retained	1
its	1
position	1
on	1
the	1
—	1
wall,	1
an	1
effigy	1
of	1
the	1
directors’	1
pet,	1
but	1
dead,	1
lamb.	1
And	1
now	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
rose,	1
to	1
present	1
the	1
report	1
and	1
accounts.	1
Veiling	1
under	1
a	1
Jove-like	1
serenity	1
that	1
perpetual	1
antagonism	1
deep-seated	1
in	1
the	1
bosom	1
of	1
a	1
director	1
towards	1
his	1
shareholders,	1
he	1
faced	1
them	1
calmly.	1
Soames	1
faced	1
them	1
too.	1
He	1
knew	1
most	1
of	1
them	1
by	1
sight.	1
There	1
was	1
old	1
Scrubsole,	1
a	1
tar	1
man,	1
who	1
always	1
came,	1
as	1
Hemmings	1
would	1
say,	1
‘to	1
make	1
himself	1
nasty,’	1
a	1
cantankerous-looking	1
old	1
fellow	1
with	1
a	1
red	1
face,	1
a	1
jowl,	1
and	1
an	1
enormous	1
low-crowned	1
hat	1
reposing	1
on	1
his	1
knee.	1
And	1
the	1
Rev.	1
Mr.	1
Boms,	1
who	1
always	1
proposed	1
a	1
vote	1
of	1
thanks	1
to	1
the	1
chairman,	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
invariably	1
expressed	1
the	1
hope	1
that	1
the	1
Board	1
would	1
not	1
forget	1
to	1
elevate	1
their	1
employees,	1
using	1
the	1
word	1
with	1
a	1
double	1
e,	1
as	1
being	1
more	1
vigorous	1
and	1
Anglo-Saxon	1
(he	1
had	1
the	1
strong	1
Imperialistic	1
tendencies	1
of	1
his	1
cloth).	1
It	1
was	1
his	1
salutary	1
custom	1
to	1
buttonhole	1
a	1
director	1
afterwards,	1
and	1
ask	1
him	1
whether	1
he	1
thought	1
the	1
coming	1
year	1
would	1
be	1
good	1
or	1
bad;	1
and,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
trend	1
of	1
the	1
answer,	1
to	1
buy	1
or	1
sell	1
three	1
shares	1
within	1
the	1
ensuing	1
fortnight.	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
that	1
military	1
man,	1
Major	1
O’Bally,	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
speaking,	1
if	1
only	1
to	1
second	1
the	1
re-election	1
of	1
the	1
auditor,	1
and	1
who	1
sometimes	1
caused	1
serious	1
consternation	1
by	1
taking	1
toasts	1
—	1
proposals	1
rather	1
—	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
persons	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
flattered	1
with	1
little	1
slips	1
of	1
paper,	1
entrusting	1
the	1
said	1
proposals	1
to	1
their	1
care.	1
These	1
made	1
up	1
the	1
lot,	1
together	1
with	1
four	1
or	1
five	1
strong,	1
silent	1
shareholders,	1
with	1
whom	1
Soames	1
could	1
sympathize	1
—	1
men	1
of	1
business,	1
who	1
liked	1
to	1
keep	1
an	1
eye	1
on	1
their	1
affairs	1
for	1
themselves,	1
without	1
being	1
fussy	1
—	1
good,	1
solid	1
men,	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
City	1
every	1
day	1
and	1
went	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
to	1
good,	1
solid	1
wives.	1
Good,	1
solid	1
wives!	1
There	1
was	1
something	1
in	1
that	1
thought	1
which	1
roused	1
the	1
nameless	1
uneasiness	1
in	1
Soames	1
again.	1
What	1
should	1
he	1
say	1
to	1
his	1
uncle?	1
What	1
answer	1
should	1
he	1
make	1
to	1
this	1
letter?	1
.	4
“If	1
any	1
shareholder	1
has	1
any	1
question	1
to	1
put,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
answer	1
it.”	1
A	1
soft	1
thump.	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
had	1
let	1
the	1
report	1
and	1
accounts	1
fall,	1
and	1
stood	1
twisting	1
his	1
tortoise-shell	1
glasses	1
between	1
thumb	1
and	1
forefinger.	1
The	1
ghost	1
of	1
a	1
smile	1
appeared	1
on	1
Soames’	1
face.	1
They	1
had	1
better	1
hurry	1
up	1
with	1
their	1
questions!	1
He	1
well	1
knew	1
his	1
uncle’s	1
method	1
(the	1
ideal	1
one)	1
of	1
at	1
once	1
saying:	1
“I	1
propose,	1
then,	1
that	1
the	1
report	1
and	1
accounts	1
be	1
adopted!”	1
Never	1
let	1
them	1
get	1
their	1
wind	1
—	1
shareholders	1
were	1
notoriously	1
wasteful	1
of	1
time!	1
A	1
tall,	1
white-bearded	1
man,	1
with	1
a	1
gaunt,	1
dissatisfied	1
face,	1
arose:	1
“I	1
believe	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
order,	1
Mr.	1
Chairman,	1
in	1
raising	1
a	1
question	1
on	1
this	1
figure	1
of	1
L5000	1
in	1
the	1
accounts.	1
‘To	1
the	1
widow	1
and	1
family”’	1
(he	1
looked	1
sourly	1
round),	1
“‘of	1
our	1
late	1
superintendent,’	1
who	1
so	1
—	1
er	1
—	1
ill-advisedly	1
(I	1
say	1
—	1
ill-advisedly)	1
committed	1
suicide,	1
at	1
a	1
time	1
when	1
his	1
services	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
utmost	1
value	1
to	1
this	1
Company.	1
You	1
have	1
stated	1
that	1
the	1
agreement	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
so	1
unfortunately	1
cut	1
short	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
hand	1
was	1
for	1
a	1
period	1
of	1
five	1
years,	1
of	1
which	1
one	1
only	1
had	1
expired	1
—	1
I—”	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
made	1
a	1
gesture	1
of	1
impatience.	1
“I	1
believe	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
order,	1
Mr.	1
Chairman	1
—	1
I	1
ask	1
whether	1
this	1
amount	1
paid,	1
or	1
proposed	1
to	1
be	1
paid,	1
by	1
the	1
Board	1
to	1
the	1
er	1
—	1
deceased	1
—	1
is	1
for	1
services	1
which	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
rendered	1
to	1
the	1
Company	1
—	1
had	1
he	1
not	1
committed	1
suicide?”	1
“It	1
is	1
in	1
recognition	1
of	1
past	1
services,	1
which	1
we	1
all	1
know	1
—	1
you	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
any	1
of	1
us	1
—	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
of	1
vital	1
value.”	1
“Then,	1
sir,	1
all	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
say	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
services	1
being	1
past,	1
the	1
amount	1
is	1
too	1
much.”	1
The	1
shareholder	1
sat	1
down.	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
waited	1
a	1
second	1
and	1
said:	1
“I	1
now	1
propose	1
that	1
the	1
report	1
and	1
—”	1
The	1
shareholder	1
rose	1
again:	1
“May	1
I	1
ask	1
if	1
the	1
Board	1
realizes	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
their	1
money	1
which	1
—	1
I	1
don’t	1
hesitate	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
their	1
money.	1
.	3
”	1
A	1
second	1
shareholder,	1
with	1
a	1
round,	1
dogged	1
face,	1
whom	1
Soames	1
recognised	1
as	1
the	1
late	1
superintendent’s	1
brother-in-law,	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
said	1
warmly:	1
“In	1
my	1
opinion,	1
sir,	1
the	1
sum	1
is	1
not	1
enough!”	1
The	1
Rev.	1
Mr.	1
Boms	1
now	1
rose	1
to	1
his	1
feet.	1
“If	1
I	1
may	1
venture	1
to	1
express	1
myself,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“I	1
should	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
fact	1
of	1
the	1
—	1
er	1
—	1
deceased	1
having	1
committed	1
suicide	1
should	1
weigh	1
very	1
heavily	1
—	1
very	1
heavily	1
with	1
our	1
worthy	1
chairman.	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
it	1
has	1
weighed	1
with	1
him,	1
for	1
—	1
I	1
say	1
this	1
for	1
myself	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
for	1
everyone	1
present	1
(hear,	1
hear)—	1
he	1
enjoys	1
our	1
confidence	1
in	1
a	1
high	1
degree.	1
We	1
all	1
desire,	1
I	1
should	1
hope,	1
to	1
be	1
charitable.	1
But	1
I	1
feel	1
sure”	1
(he-looked	1
severely	1
at	1
the	1
late	1
superintendent’s	1
brother-in-law)	1
“that	1
he	1
will	1
in	1
some	1
way,	1
by	1
some	1
written	1
expression,	1
or	1
better	1
perhaps	1
by	1
reducing	1
the	1
amount,	1
record	1
our	1
grave	1
disapproval	1
that	1
so	1
promising	1
and	1
valuable	1
a	1
life	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
thus	1
impiously	1
removed	1
from	1
a	1
sphere	1
where	1
both	1
its	1
own	1
interests	1
and	1
—	1
if	1
I	1
may	1
say	1
so	1
—	1
our	1
interests	1
so	1
imperatively	1
demanded	1
its	1
continuance.	1
We	1
should	1
not	1
—	1
nay,	1
we	1
may	1
not	1
—	1
countenance	1
so	1
grave	1
a	1
dereliction	1
of	1
all	1
duty,	1
both	1
human	1
and	1
divine.”	1
The	1
reverend	1
gentleman	1
resumed	1
his	1
seat.	1
The	1
late	1
superintendent’s	1
brother-in-law	1
again	1
rose:	1
“What	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
I	1
stick	1
to,”	1
he	1
said;	1
“the	1
amount	1
is	1
not	1
enough!”	1
The	1
first	1
shareholder	1
struck	1
in:	1
“I	1
challenge	1
the	1
legality	1
of	1
the	1
payment.	1
In	1
my	1
opinion	1
this	1
payment	1
is	1
not	1
legal.	1
The	1
Company’s	1
solicitor	1
is	1
present;	1
I	1
believe	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
order	1
in	1
asking	1
him	1
the	1
question.”	1
All	1
eyes	1
were	1
now	1
turned	1
upon	1
Soames.	1
Something	1
had	1
arisen!	1
He	1
stood	1
up,	1
close-lipped	1
and	1
cold;	1
his	1
nerves	1
inwardly	1
fluttered,	1
his	1
attention	1
tweaked	1
away	1
at	1
last	1
from	1
contemplation	1
of	1
that	1
cloud	1
looming	1
on	1
the	1
horizon	1
of	1
his	1
mind.	1
“The	1
point,”	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
low,	1
thin	1
voice,	1
“is	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
clear.	1
As	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
possibility	1
of	1
future	1
consideration	1
being	1
received,	1
it	1
is	1
doubtful	1
whether	1
the	1
payment	1
is	1
strictly	1
legal.	1
If	1
it	1
is	1
desired,	1
the	1
opinion	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
could	1
be	1
taken.”	1
The	1
superintendent’s	1
brother-in-law	1
frowned,	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
meaning	1
tone:	1
“We	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
the	1
opinion	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
could	1
be	1
taken.	1
May	1
I	1
ask	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
gentleman	1
who	1
has	1
given	1
us	1
that	1
striking	1
piece	1
of	1
information?	1
Mr.	1
Soames	1
Forsyte?	1
Indeed!”	1
He	1
looked	1
from	1
Soames	1
to	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
in	1
a	1
pointed	1
manner.	1
A	1
flush	1
coloured	1
Soames’	1
pale	1
cheeks,	1
but	1
his	1
superciliousness	1
did	1
not	1
waver.	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
fixed	1
his	1
eyes	1
on	1
the	1
speaker.	1
“If,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“the	1
late	1
superintendents	1
brother-in-law	1
has	1
nothing	1
more	1
to	1
say,	1
I	1
propose	1
that	1
the	1
report	1
and	1
accounts.	1
.	3
”	1
At	1
this	1
moment,	1
however,	1
there	1
rose	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
five	1
silent,	1
stolid	1
shareholders,	1
who	1
had	1
excited	1
Soames’	1
sympathy.	1
He	1
said:	1
“I	1
deprecate	1
the	1
proposal	1
altogether.	1
We	1
are	1
expected	1
to	1
give	1
charity	1
to	1
this	1
man’s	1
wife	1
and	1
children,	1
who,	1
you	1
tell	1
us,	1
were	1
dependent	1
on	1
him.	1
They	1
may	1
have	1
been;	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
care	1
whether	1
they	1
were	1
or	1
not.	1
I	1
object	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
thing	1
on	1
principle.	1
It	1
is	1
high	1
time	1
a	1
stand	1
was	1
made	1
against	1
this	1
sentimental	1
humanitarianism.	1
The	1
country	1
is	1
eaten	1
up	1
with	1
it.	1
I	1
object	1
to	1
my	1
money	1
being	1
paid	1
to	1
these	1
people	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
know	1
nothing,	1
who	1
have	1
done	1
nothing	1
to	1
earn	1
it.	1
I	1
object	1
in	1
toto;	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
business.	1
I	1
now	1
move	1
that	1
the	1
report	1
and	1
accounts	1
be	1
put	1
back,	1
and	1
amended	1
by	1
striking	1
out	1
the	1
grant	1
altogether.”	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
had	1
remained	1
standing	1
while	1
the	1
strong,	1
silent	1
man	1
was	1
speaking.	1
The	1
speech	1
awoke	1
an	1
echo	1
in	1
all	1
hearts,	1
voicing,	1
as	1
it	1
did,	1
the	1
worship	1
of	1
strong	1
men,	1
the	1
movement	1
against	1
generosity,	1
which	1
had	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
already	1
commenced	1
among	1
the	1
saner	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
community.	1
The	1
words	1
‘it	1
is	1
not	1
business’	1
had	1
moved	1
even	1
the	1
Board;	1
privately	1
everyone	1
felt	1
that	1
indeed	1
it	1
was	1
not.	1
But	1
they	1
knew	1
also	1
the	1
chairman’s	1
domineering	1
temper	1
and	1
tenacity.	1
He,	1
too,	1
at	1
heart	1
must	1
feel	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
business;	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
committed	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
proposition.	1
Would	1
he	1
go	1
back	1
upon	1
it?	1
It	1
was	1
thought	1
to	1
be	1
unlikely.	1
All	1
waited	1
with	1
interest.	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
held	1
up	1
his	1
hand;	1
dark-rimmed	1
glasses	1
depending	1
between	1
his	1
finger	1
and	1
thumb	1
quivered	1
slightly	1
with	1
a	1
suggestion	1
of	1
menace.	1
He	1
addressed	1
the	1
strong,	1
silent	1
shareholder.	1
“Knowing,	1
as	1
you	1
do,	1
the	1
efforts	1
of	1
our	1
late	1
superintendent	1
upon	1
the	1
occasion	1
of	1
the	1
explosion	1
at	1
the	1
mines,	1
do	1
you	1
seriously	1
wish	1
me	1
to	1
put	1
that	1
amendment,	1
sir?”	1
“I	1
do.”	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
put	1
the	1
amendment.	1
“Does	1
anyone	1
second	1
this?”	1
he	1
asked,	1
looking	1
calmly	1
round.	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
then	1
that	1
Soames,	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
uncle,	1
felt	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
will	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
that	1
old	1
man.	1
No	1
one	1
stirred.	1
Looking	1
straight	1
into	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
strong,	1
silent	1
shareholder,	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
said:	1
“I	1
now	1
move,	1
‘That	1
the	1
report	1
and	1
accounts	1
for	1
the	1
year	1
1886	1
be	1
received	1
and	1
adopted.’	1
You	1
second	1
that?	1
Those	1
in	1
favour	1
signify	1
the	1
same	1
in	1
the	1
usual	1
way.	1
Contrary	1
—	1
no.	1
Carried.	1
The	1
next	1
business,	1
gentlemen.	1
.	3
”	1
Soames	1
smiled.	1
Certainly	1
Uncle	1
Jolyon	1
had	1
a	1
way	1
with	1
him!	1
But	1
now	1
his	1
attention	1
relapsed	1
upon	1
Bosinney.	1
Odd	1
how	1
that	1
fellow	1
haunted	1
his	1
thoughts,	1
even	1
in	1
business	1
hours.	1
Irene’s	1
visit	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
—	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
in	1
that,	1
except	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
have	1
told	1
him;	1
but	1
then,	1
again,	1
she	1
never	1
did	1
tell	1
him	1
anything.	1
She	1
was	1
more	1
silent,	1
more	1
touchy,	1
every	1
day.	1
He	1
wished	1
to	1
God	1
the	1
house	1
were	1
finished,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
it,	1
away	1
from	1
London.	1
Town	1
did	1
not	1
suit	1
her;	1
her	1
nerves	1
were	1
not	1
strong	1
enough.	1
That	1
nonsense	1
of	1
the	1
separate	1
room	1
had	1
cropped	1
up	1
again!	1
The	1
meeting	1
was	1
breaking	1
up	1
now.	1
Underneath	1
the	1
photograph	1
of	1
the	1
lost	1
shaft	1
Hemmings	1
was	1
buttonholed	1
by	1
the	1
Rev.	1
Mr.	1
Boms.	1
Little	1
Mr.	1
Booker,	1
his	1
bristling	1
eyebrows	1
wreathed	1
in	1
angry	1
smiles,	1
was	1
having	1
a	1
parting	1
turn-up	1
with	1
old	1
Scrubsole.	1
The	1
two	1
hated	1
each	1
other	1
like	1
poison.	1
There	1
was	1
some	1
matter	1
of	1
a	1
tar-contract	1
between	1
them,	1
little	1
Mr.	1
Booker	1
having	1
secured	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
Board	1
for	1
a	1
nephew	1
of	1
his,	1
over	1
old	1
Scrubsole’s	1
head.	1
Soames	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
from	1
Hemmings,	1
who	1
liked	1
a	1
gossip,	1
more	1
especially	1
about	1
his	1
directors,	1
except,	1
indeed,	1
old	1
Jolyon,	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
afraid.	1
Soames	1
awaited	1
his	1
opportunity.	1
The	1
last	1
shareholder	1
was	1
vanishing	1
through	1
the	1
door,	1
when	1
he	1
approached	1
his	1
uncle,	1
who	1
was	1
putting	1
on	1
his	1
hat.	1
“Can	1
I	1
speak	1
to	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
minute,	1
Uncle	1
Jolyon?”	1
It	1
is	1
uncertain	1
what	1
Soames	1
expected	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
interview.	1
Apart	1
from	1
that	1
somewhat	1
mysterious	1
awe	1
in	1
which	1
Forsytes	1
in	1
general	1
held	1
old	1
Jolyon,	1
due	1
to	1
his	1
philosophic	1
twist,	1
or	1
perhaps	1
—	1
as	1
Hemmings	1
would	1
doubtless	1
have	1
said	1
—	1
to	1
his	1
chin,	1
there	1
was,	1
and	1
always	1
had	1
been,	1
a	1
subtle	1
antagonism	1
between	1
the	1
younger	1
man	1
and	1
the	1
old.	1
It	1
had	1
lurked	1
under	1
their	1
dry	1
manner	1
of	1
greeting,	1
under	1
their	1
non-committal	1
allusions	1
to	1
each	1
other,	1
and	1
arose	1
perhaps	1
from	1
old	1
Jolyon’s	1
perception	1
of	1
the	1
quiet	1
tenacity	1
(‘obstinacy,’	1
he	1
rather	1
naturally	1
called	1
it)	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
man,	1
of	1
a	1
secret	1
doubt	1
whether	1
he	1
could	1
get	1
his	1
own	1
way	1
with	1
him.	1
Both	1
these	1
Forsytes,	1
wide	1
asunder	1
as	1
the	1
poles	1
in	1
many	1
respects,	1
possessed	1
in	1
their	1
different	1
ways	1
—	1
to	1
a	1
greater	1
degree	1
than	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
—	1
that	1
essential	1
quality	1
of	1
tenacious	1
and	1
prudent	1
insight	1
into	1
‘affairs,’	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
highwater	1
mark	1
of	1
their	1
great	1
class.	1
Either	1
of	1
them,	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
luck	1
and	1
opportunity,	1
was	1
equal	1
to	1
a	1
lofty	1
career;	1
either	1
of	1
them	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
good	1
financier,	1
a	1
great	1
contractor,	1
a	1
statesman,	1
though	1
old	1
Jolyon,	1
in	1
certain	1
of	1
his	1
moods	1
when	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
a	1
cigar	1
or	1
of	1
Nature	1
—	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
capable	1
of,	1
not	1
perhaps	1
despising,	1
but	1
certainly	1
of	1
questioning,	1
his	1
own	1
high	1
position,	1
while	1
Soames,	1
who	1
never	1
smoked	1
cigars,	1
would	1
not.	1
Then,	1
too,	1
in	1
old	1
Jolyon’s	1
mind	1
there	1
was	1
always	1
the	1
secret	1
ache,	1
that	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
James	1
—	1
of	1
James,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
thought	1
such	1
a	1
poor	1
thing,	1
should	1
be	1
pursuing	1
the	1
paths	1
of	1
success,	1
while	1
his	1
own	1
son	1
.	2
.!	1
And	1
last,	1
not	1
least	1
—	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
no	1
more	1
outside	1
the	1
radiation	1
of	1
family	1
gossip	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
Forsyte	1
—	1
he	1
had	1
now	1
heard	1
the	1
sinister,	1
indefinite,	1
but	1
none	1
the	1
less	1
disturbing	1
rumour	1
about	1
Bosinney,	1
and	1
his	1
pride	1
was	1
wounded	1
to	1
the	1
quick.	1
Characteristically,	1
his	1
irritation	1
turned	1
not	1
against	1
Irene	1
but	1
against	1
Soames.	1
The	1
idea	1
that	1
his	1
nephew’s	1
wife	1
(why	1
couldn’t	1
the	1
fellow	1
take	1
better	1
care	1
of	1
her	1
—	1
Oh!	1
quaint	1
injustice!	1
as	1
though	1
Soames	1
could	1
possibly	1
take	1
more	1
care!)—	1
should	1
be	1
drawing	1
to	1
herself	1
June’s	1
lover,	1
was	1
intolerably	1
humiliating.	1
And	1
seeing	1
the	1
danger,	1
he	1
did	1
not,	1
like	1
James,	1
hide	1
it	1
away	1
in	1
sheer	1
nervousness,	1
but	1
owned	1
with	1
the	1
dispassion	1
of	1
his	1
broader	1
outlook,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
unlikely;	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
very	1
attractive	1
about	1
Irene!	1
He	1
had	1
a	1
presentiment	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
Soames’	1
communication	1
as	1
they	1
left	1
the	1
Board	1
Room	1
together,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
noise	1
and	1
hurry	1
of	1
Cheapside.	1
They	1
walked	1
together	1
a	1
good	1
minute	1
without	1
speaking,	1
Soames	1
with	1
his	1
mousing,	1
mincing	1
step,	1
and	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
upright	1
and	1
using	1
his	1
umbrella	1
languidly	1
as	1
a	1
walking-stick.	1
They	1
turned	1
presently	1
into	1
comparative	1
quiet,	1
for	1
old	1
Jolyon’s	1
way	1
to	1
a	1
second	1
Board	1
led	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
Moorage	1
Street.	1
Then	1
Soames,	1
without	1
lifting	1
his	1
eyes,	1
began:	1
“I’ve	1
had	1
this	1
letter	1
from	1
Bosinney.	1
You	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
says;	1
I	1
thought	1
I’d	1
let	1
you	1
know.	1
I’ve	1
spent	1
a	1
lot	1
more	1
than	1
I	1
intended	1
on	1
this	1
house,	1
and	1
I	1
want	1
the	1
position	1
to	1
be	1
clear.”	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
ran	1
his	1
eyes	1
unwillingly	1
over	1
the	1
letter:	1
“What	1
he	1
says	1
is	1
clear	1
enough,”	1
he	1
said.	1
“He	1
talks	1
about	1
‘a	1
free	1
hand,’”	1
replied	1
Soames.	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
looked	1
at	1
him.	1
The	1
long-suppressed	1
irritation	1
and	1
antagonism	1
towards	1
this	1
young	1
fellow,	1
whose	1
affairs	1
were	1
beginning	1
to	1
intrude	1
upon	1
his	1
own,	1
burst	1
from	1
him.	1
“Well,	1
if	1
you	1
don’t	1
trust	1
him,	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
employ	1
him?”	1
Soames	1
stole	1
a	1
sideway	1
look:	1
“It’s	1
much	1
too	1
late	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
that,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“I	1
only	1
want	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
quite	1
understood	1
that	1
if	1
I	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
free	1
hand,	1
he	1
doesn’t	1
let	1
me	1
in.	1
I	1
thought	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
him,	1
it	1
would	1
carry	1
more	1
weight!”	1
“No,”	1
said	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
abruptly;	1
“I’ll	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
it!”	1
The	1
words	1
of	1
both	1
uncle	1
and	1
nephew	1
gave	1
the	1
impression	1
of	1
unspoken	1
meanings,	1
far	1
more	1
important,	1
behind.	1
And	1
the	1
look	1
they	1
interchanged	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
revelation	1
of	1
this	1
consciousness.	1
“Well,”	1
said	1
Soames;	1
“I	1
thought,	1
for	1
June’s	1
sake,	1
I’d	1
tell	1
you,	1
that’s	1
all;	1
I	1
thought	1
you’d	1
better	1
know	1
I	1
shan’t	1
stand	1
any	1
nonsense!”	1
“What	1
is	1
that	1
to	1
me?”	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
took	1
him	1
up.	1
“Oh!	1
I	1
don’t	1
know,”	1
said	1
Soames,	1
and	1
flurried	1
by	1
that	1
sharp	1
look	1
he	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
say	1
more.	1
“Don’t	1
say	1
I	1
didn’t	1
tell	1
you,”	1
he	1
added	1
sulkily,	1
recovering	1
his	1
composure.	1
“Tell	1
me!”	1
said	1
old	1
Jolyon;	1
“I	1
don’t	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
mean.	1
You	1
come	1
worrying	1
me	1
about	1
a	1
thing	1
like	1
this.	1
I	1
don’t	1
want	1
to	1
hear	1
about	1
your	1
affairs;	1
you	1
must	1
manage	1
them	1
yourself!”	1
“Very	1
well,”	1
said	1
Soames	1
immovably,	1
“I	1
will!”	1
“Good-morning,	1
then,”	1
said	1
old	1
Jolyon,	1
and	1
they	1
parted.	1
Soames	1
retraced	1
his	1
steps,	1
and	1
going	1
into	1
a	1
celebrated	1
eating-house,	1
asked	1
for	1
a	1
plate	1
of	1
smoked	1
salmon	1
and	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
Chablis;	1
he	1
seldom	1
ate	1
much	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
day,	1
and	1
generally	1
ate	1
standing,	1
finding	1
the	1
position	1
beneficial	1
to	1
his	1
liver,	1
which	1
was	1
very	1
sound,	1
but	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
desired	1
to	1
put	1
down	1
all	1
his	1
troubles.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
he	1
went	1
slowly	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
office,	1
with	1
bent	1
head,	1
taking	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
the	1
swarming	1
thousands	1
on	1
the	1
pavements,	1
who	1
in	1
their	1
turn	1
took	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
him.	1
The	1
evening	1
post	1
carried	1
the	1
following	1
reply	1
to	1
Bosinney:	1
‘FORSYTE,	1
BUSTARD	1

Oaths,	1
‘92001,	1
BRANCH	1

POULTRY,	1
E.C.,	1
‘May	1
17,	1
1887.	1
‘DEAR	1
BOSINNEY,	1
‘I	1
have,	1
received	1
your	1
letter,	1
the	1
terms	1
of	1
which	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
surprise	1
me.	1
I	1
was	1
under	1
the	1
impression	1
that	1
you	1
had,	1
and	1
have	1
had	1
all	1
along,	1
a	1
“free	1
hand”;	1
for	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
recollect	1
that	1
any	1
suggestions	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
unfortunate	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
have	1
met	1
with	1
your	1
approval.	1
In	1
giving	1
you,	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
your	1
request,	1
this	1
“free	1
hand,”	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
to	1
clearly	1
understand	1
that	1

total	1
cost	1
of	1
the	1
house	1

handed	1
over	1
to	1
me	1
completely	1
decorated,	1
inclusive	1
of	1
your	1
fee	1
(as	1
arranged	1
between	1
us),	1
must	1
not	1
exceed	1
twelve	1
thousand	1
pounds	1
—	1
L12,000.	1
This	1
gives	1
you	1
an	1
ample	1
margin,	1
and,	1
as	1
you	1
know,	1
is	1
far	1
more	1
than	1
I	1
originally	1
contemplated.	1
‘I	1
am,	1
‘Yours	1
truly,	1
‘SOAMES	1
FORSYTE.’	1
On	1
the	1
following	1
day	1
he	1
received	1
a	1
note	1
from	1
Bosinney:	1
‘PHILIP	1

you	1

bind	1
myself	1
to	1
the	1

I	1
am	1
afraid	1
you	1

mistaken.	1
I	1
can	1
see	1
that	1
you	1
are	1

‘Yours	1

Soames	1
pondered	1
long	1
and	1
painfully	1
over	1
his	1
answer,	1
and	1
late	1
at	1
night	1
in	1
the	1
dining-room,	1
when	1
Irene	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
bed,	1
he	1
composed	1
the	1
following:	1
‘62,	1
MONTPELLIER	1
SQUARE,	1
S.W.,	1
‘May	1
19,	1
1887.	1
‘DEAR	1
BOSINNEY,	1
‘I	1
think	1
that	1
in	1
both	1
our	1
interests	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
extremely	1
undesirable	1
that	1
matters	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
left	1
at	1
this	1
stage.	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
mean	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
should	1
exceed	1
the	1
sum	1
named	1
in	1
my	1
letter	1
to	1
you	1
by	1
ten	1
or	1
twenty	1
or	1
even	1
fifty	1
pounds,	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
any	1
difficulty	1

This	1
being	1
so,	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
you	1
to	1

a	1
“free	1

absolutely	1
exact.	1
‘Yours	1
truly,	1
‘SOAMES	1
FORSYTE.’	1
Bosinney’s	1
answer,	1
which	1
came	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
was:	1
‘May	1
20.	1
‘DEAR	1

‘Very	1

Chapter	1
15	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
at	1
the	1
Zoo	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
disposed	1
of	1
his	1
second	1
Meeting	1
—	1
an	1
ordinary	1
Board	1
—	1
summarily.	1
He	1
was	1
so	1
dictatorial	1
that	1
his	1
fellow	1
directors	1
were	1
left	1
in	1
cabal	1
over	1
the	1
increasing	1
domineeringness	1
of	1
old	1
Forsyte,	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
far	1
from	1
intending	1
to	1
stand	1
much	1
longer,	1
they	1
said.	1
He	1
went	1
out	1
by	1
Underground	1
to	1
Portland	1
Road	1
Station,	1
whence	1
he	1
took	1
a	1
cab	1
and	1
drove	1
to	1
the	1
Zoo.	1
He	1
had	1
an	1
assignation	1
there,	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
assignations	1
that	1
had	1
lately	1
been	1
growing	1
more	1
frequent,	1
to	1
which	1
his	1
increasing	1
uneasiness	1
about	1
June	1
and	1
the	1
‘change	1
in	1
her,’	1
as	1
he	1
expressed	1
it,	1
was	1
driving	1
him.	1
She	1
buried	1
herself	1
away,	1
and	1
was	1
growing	1
thin;	1
if	1
he	1
spoke	1
to	1
her	1
he	1
got	1
no	1
answer,	1
or	1
had	1
his	1
head	1
snapped	1
off,	1
or	1
she	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
would	1
burst	1
into	1
tears.	1
She	1
was	1
as	1
changed	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
be,	1
all	1
through	1
this	1
Bosinney.	1
As	1
for	1
telling	1
him	1
about	1
anything,	1
not	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
it!	1
And	1
he	1
would	1
sit	1
for	1
long	1
spells	1
brooding,	1
his	1
paper	1
unread	1
before	1
him,	1
a	1
cigar	1
extinct	1
between	1
his	1
lips.	1
She	1
had	1
been	1
such	1
a	1
companion	1
to	1
him	1
ever	1
since	1
she	1
was	1
three	1
years	1
old!	1
And	1
he	1
loved	1
her	1
so!	1
Forces	1
regardless	1
of	1
family	1
or	1
class	1
or	1
custom	1
were	1
beating	1
down	1
his	1
guard;	1
impending	1
events	1
over	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
control	1
threw	1
their	1
shadows	1
on	1
his	1
head.	1
The	1
irritation	1
of	1
one	1
accustomed	1
to	1
have	1
his	1
way	1
was	1
roused	1
against	1
he	1
knew	1
not	1
what.	1
Chafing	1
at	1
the	1
slowness	1
of	1
his	1
cab,	1
he	1
reached	1
the	1
Zoo	1
door;	1
but,	1
with	1
his	1
sunny	1
instinct	1
for	1
seizing	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
each	1
moment,	1
he	1
forgot	1
his	1
vexation	1
as	1
he	1
walked	1
towards	1
the	1
tryst.	1
From	1
the	1
stone	1
terrace	1
above	1
the	1
bear-pit	1
his	1
son	1
and	1
his	1
two	1
grandchildren	1
came	1
hastening	1
down	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
coming,	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
away	1
towards	1
the	1
lion-house.	1
They	1
supported	1
him	1
on	1
either	1
side,	1
holding	1
one	1
to	1
each	1
of	1
his	1
hands	1
—	1
whilst	1
Jolly,	1
perverse	1
like	1
his	1
father,	1
carried	1
his	1
grandfather’s	1
umbrella	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
as	1
to	1
catch	1
people’s	1
legs	1
with	1
the	1
crutch	1
of	1
the	1
handle.	1
Young	1
Jolyon	1
followed.	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
a	1
play	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
father	1
with	1
the	1
children,	1
but	1
such	1
a	1
play	1
as	1
brings	1
smiles	1
with	1
tears	1
behind.	1
An	1
old	1
man	1
and	1
two	1
small	1
children	1
walking	1
together	1
can	1
be	1
seen	1
at	1
any	1
hour	1
of	1
the	1
day;	1
but	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
old	1
Jolyon,	1
with	1
Jolly	1
and	1
Holly	1
seemed	1
to	1
young	1
Jolyon	1
a	1
special	1
peep-show	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
lie	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
our	1
hearts.	1
The	1
complete	1
surrender	1
of	1
that	1
erect	1
old	1
figure	1
to	1
those	1
little	1
figures	1
on	1
either	1
hand	1
was	1
too	1
poignantly	1
tender,	1
and,	1
being	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
an	1
habitual	1
reflex	1
action,	1
young	1
Jolyon	1
swore	1
softly	1
under	1
his	1
breath.	1
The	1
show	1
affected	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
unbecoming	1
to	1
a	1
Forsyte,	1
who	1
is	1
nothing	1
if	1
not	1
undemonstrative.	1
Thus	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
lion-house.	1
There	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
morning	1
fete	1
at	1
the	1
Botanical	1
Gardens,	1
and	1
a	1
large	1
number	1
of	1
Forsy	1
.	3
’—	1
that	1
is,	1
of	1
well-dressed	1
people	1
who	1
kept	1
carriages	1
had	1
brought	1
them	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
Zoo,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
have	1
more,	1
if	1
possible,	1
for	1
their	1
money,	1
before	1
going	1
back	1
to	1
Rutland	1
Gate	1
or	1
Bryanston	1
Square.	1
“Let’s	1
go	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
Zoo,”	1
they	1
had	1
said	1
to	1
each	1
other;	1
“it’ll	1
be	1
great	1
fun!”	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
shilling	1
day;	1
and	1
there	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
all	1
those	1
horrid	1
common	1
people.	1
In	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
long	1
line	1
of	1
cages	1
they	1
were	1
collected	1
in	1
rows,	1
watching	1
the	1
tawny,	1
ravenous	1
beasts	1
behind	1
the	1
bars	1
await	1
their	1
only	1
pleasure	1
of	1
the	1
four-and-twenty	1
hours.	1
The	1
hungrier	1
the	1
beast,	1
the	1
greater	1
the	1
fascination.	1
But	1
whether	1
because	1
the	1
spectators	1
envied	1
his	1
appetite,	1
or,	1
more	1
humanely,	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
soon	1
to	1
be	1
satisfied,	1
young	1
Jolyon	1
could	1
not	1
tell.	1
Remarks	1
kept	1
falling	1
on	1
his	1
ears:	1
“That’s	1
a	1
nasty-looking	1
brute,	1
that	1
tiger!”	1
“Oh,	1
what	1
a	1
love!	1
Look	1
at	1
his	1
little	1
mouth!”	1
“Yes,	1
he’s	1
rather	1
nice!	1
Don’t	1
go	1
too	1
near,	1
mother.”	1
And	1
frequently,	1
with	1
little	1
pats,	1
one	1
or	1
another	1
would	1
clap	1
their	1
hands	1
to	1
their	1
pockets	1
behind	1
and	1
look	1
round,	1
as	1
though	1
expecting	1
young	1
Jolyon	1
or	1
some	1
disinterested-looking	1
person	1
to	1
relieve	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
contents.	1
A	1
well-fed	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
white	1
waistcoat	1
said	1
slowly	1
through	1
his	1
teeth:	1
“It’s	1
all	1
greed;	1
they	1
can’t	1
be	1
hungry.	1
Why,	1
they	1
take	1
no	1
exercise.”	1
At	1
these	1
words	1
a	1
tiger	1
snatched	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
bleeding	1
liver,	1
and	1
the	1
fat	1
man	1
laughed.	1
His	1
wife,	1
in	1
a	1
Paris	1
model	1
frock	1
and	1
gold	1
nose-nippers,	1
reproved	1
him:	1
“How	1
can	1
you	1
laugh,	1
Harry?	1
Such	1
a	1
horrid	1
sight!”	1
Young	1
Jolyon	1
frowned.	1
The	1
circumstances	1
of	1
his	1
life,	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
ceased	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
too	1
personal	1
view	1
of	1
them,	1
had	1
left	1
him	1
subject	1
to	1
an	1
intermittent	1
contempt;	1
and	1
the	1
class	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
belonged	1
—	1
the	1
carriage	1
class	1
—	1
especially	1
excited	1
his	1
sarcasm.	1
To	1
shut	1
up	1
a	1
lion	1
or	1
tiger	1
in	1
confinement	1
was	1
surely	1
a	1
horrible	1
barbarity.	1
But	1
no	1
cultivated	1
person	1
would	1
admit	1
this.	1
The	1
idea	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
barbarous	1
to	1
confine	1
wild	1
animals	1
had	1
probably	1
never	1
even	1
occurred	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
for	1
instance;	1
he	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
old	1
school,	1
who	1
considered	1
it	1
at	1
once	1
humanizing	1
and	1
educational	1
to	1
confine	1
baboons	1
and	1
panthers,	1
holding	1
the	1
view,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
that	1
in	1
course	1
of	1
time	1
they	1
might	1
induce	1
these	1
creatures	1
not	1
so	1
unreasonably	1
to	1
die	1
of	1
misery	1
and	1
heart-sickness	1
against	1
the	1
bars	1
of	1
their	1
cages,	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
society	1
to	1
the	1
expense	1
of	1
getting	1
others!	1
In	1
his	1
eyes,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
all	1
Forsytes,	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
seeing	1
these	1
beautiful	1
creatures	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
captivity	1
far	1
outweighed	1
the	1
inconvenience	1
of	1
imprisonment	1
to	1
beasts	1
whom	1
God	1
had	1
so	1
improvidently	1
placed	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
freedom!	1
It	1
was	1
for	1
the	1
animals	1
good,	1
removing	1
them	1
at	1
once	1
from	1
the	1
countless	1
dangers	1
of	1
open	1
air	1
and	1
exercise,	1
and	1
enabling	1
them	1
to	1
exercise	1
their	1
functions	1
in	1
the	1
guaranteed	1
seclusion	1
of	1
a	1
private	1
compartment!	1
Indeed,	1
it	1
was	1
doubtful	1
what	1
wild	1
animals	1
were	1
made	1
for	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
shut	1
up	1
in	1
cages!	1
But	1
as	1
young	1
Jolyon	1
had	1
in	1
his	1
constitution	1
the	1
elements	1
of	1
impartiality,	1
he	1
reflected	1
that	1
to	1
stigmatize	1
as	1
barbarity	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
merely	1
lack	1
of	1
imagination	1
must	1
be	1
wrong;	1
for	1
none	1
who	1
held	1
these	1
views	1
had	1
been	1
placed	1
in	1
a	1
similar	1
position	1
to	1
the	1
animals	1
they	1
caged,	1
and	1
could	1
not,	1
therefore,	1
be	1
expected	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
their	1
sensations.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
until	1
they	1
were	1
leaving	1
the	1
gardens	1
—	1
Jolly	1
and	1
Holly	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
blissful	1
delirium	1
—	1
that	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
found	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
speaking	1
to	1
his	1
son	1
on	1
the	1
matter	1
next	1
his	1
heart.	1
“I	1
don’t	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
make	1
of	1
it,”	1
he	1
said;	1
“if	1
she’s	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
as	1
she’s	1
going	1
on	1
now,	1
I	1
can’t	1
tell	1
what’s	1
to	1
come.	1
I	1
wanted	1
her	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
doctor,	1
but	1
she	1
won’t.	1
She’s	1
not	1
a	1
bit	1
like	1
me.	1
She’s	1
your	1
mother	1
all	1
over.	1
Obstinate	1
as	1
a	1
mule!	1
If	1
she	1
doesn’t	1
want	1
to	1
do	1
a	1
thing,	1
she	1
won’t,	1
and	1
there’s	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
it!”	1
Young	1
Jolyon	1
smiled;	1
his	1
eyes	1
had	1
wandered	1
to	1
his	1
father’s	1
chin.	1
‘A	1
pair	1
of	1
you,’	1
he	1
thought,	1
but	1
he	1
said	1
nothing.	1
“And	1
then,”	1
went	1
on	1
old	1
Jolyon,	1
“there’s	1
this	1
Bosinney.	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
punch	1
the	1
fellow’s	1
head,	1
but	1
I	1
can’t,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
though	1
—	1
I	1
don’t	1
see	1
why	1
you	1
shouldn’t,”	1
he	1
added	1
doubtfully.	1
“What	1
has	1
he	1
done?	1
Far	1
better	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
an	1
end,	1
if	1
they	1
don’t	1
hit	1
it	1
off!”	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
son.	1
Now	1
they	1
had	1
actually	1
come	1
to	1
discuss	1
a	1
subject	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
relations	1
between	1
the	1
sexes	1
he	1
felt	1
distrustful.	1
Jo	1
would	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
hold	1
some	1
loose	1
view	1
or	1
other.	1
“Well,	1
I	1
don’t	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
think,”	1
he	1
said;	1
“I	1
dare	1
say	1
your	1
sympathy’s	1
with	1
him	1
—	1
shouldn’t	1
be	1
surprised;	1
but	1
I	1
think	1
he’s	1
behaving	1
precious	1
badly,	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
comes	1
my	1
way	1
I	1
shall	1
tell	1
him	1
so.”	1
He	1
dropped	1
the	1
subject.	1
It	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
discuss	1
with	1
his	1
son	1
the	1
true	1
nature	1
and	1
meaning	1
of	1
Bosinney’s	1
defection.	1
Had	1
not	1
his	1
son	1
done	1
the	1
very	1
same	1
thing	1
(worse,	1
if	1
possible)	1
fifteen	1
years	1
ago?	1
There	1
seemed	1
no	1
end	1
to	1
the	1
consequences	1
of	1
that	1
piece	1
of	1
folly.	1
Young	1
Jolyon	1
also	1
was	1
silent;	1
he	1
had	1
quickly	1
penetrated	1
his	1
father’s	1
thought,	1
for,	1
dethroned	1
from	1
the	1
high	1
seat	1
of	1
an	1
obvious	1
and	1
uncomplicated	1
view	1
of	1
things,	1
he	1
had	1
become	1
both	1
perceptive	1
and	1
subtle.	1
The	1
attitude	1
he	1
had	1
adopted	1
towards	1
sexual	1
matters	1
fifteen	1
years	1
before,	1
however,	1
was	1
too	1
different	1
from	1
his	1
father’s.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
bridging	1
the	1
gulf.	1
He	1
said	1
coolly:	1
“I	1
suppose	1
he’s	1
fallen	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
some	1
other	1
woman?”	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
dubious	1
look:	1
“I	1
can’t	1
tell,”	1
he	1
said;	1
“they	1
say	1
so!”	1
“Then,	1
it’s	1
probably	1
true,”	1
remarked	1
young	1
Jolyon	1
unexpectedly;	1
“and	1
I	1
suppose	1
they’ve	1
told	1
you	1
who	1
she	1
is?”	1
“Yes,”	1
said	1
old	1
Jolyon,	1
“Soames’s	1
wife!”	1
Young	1
Jolyon	1
did	1
not	1
whistle:	1
The	1
circumstances	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
life	1
had	1
rendered	1
him	1
incapable	1
of	1
whistling	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
subject,	1
but	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
father,	1
while	1
the	1
ghost	1
of	1
a	1
smile	1
hovered	1
over	1
his	1
face.	1
If	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
saw,	1
he	1
took	1
no	1
notice.	1
“She	1
and	1
June	1
were	1
bosom	1
friends!”	1
he	1
muttered.	1
“Poor	1
little	1
June!”	1
said	1
young	1
Jolyon	1
softly.	1
He	1
thought	1
of	1
his	1
daughter	1
still	1
as	1
a	1
babe	1
of	1
three.	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
sudden	1
halt.	1
“I	1
don’t	1
believe	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
it,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“it’s	1
some	1
old	1
woman’s	1
tale.	1
Get	1
me	1
a	1
cab,	1
Jo,	1
I’m	1
tired	1
to	1
death!”	1
They	1
stood	1
at	1
a	1
corner	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
an	1
empty	1
cab	1
would	1
come	1
along,	1
while	1
carriage	1
after	1
carriage	1
drove	1
past,	1
bearing	1
Forsytes	1
of	1
all	1
descriptions	1
from	1
the	1
Zoo.	1
The	1
harness,	1
the	1
liveries,	1
the	1
gloss	1
on	1
the	1
horses’	1
coats,	1
shone	1
and	1
glittered	1
in	1
the	1
May	1
sunlight,	1
and	1
each	1
equipage,	1
landau,	1
sociable,	1
barouche,	1
Victoria,	1
or	1
brougham,	1
seemed	1
to	1
roll	1
out	1
proudly	1
from	1
its	1
wheels:	1
‘I	1
and	1
my	1
horses	1
and	1
my	1
men	1
you	1
know,’	1
Indeed	1
the	1
whole	1
turn-out	1
have	1
cost	1
a	1
pot.	1
But	1
we	1
were	1
worth	1
it	1
every	1
penny.	1
Look	1
At	1
Master	1
and	1
at	1
Missis	1
now,	1
the	1
dawgs!	1
Ease	1
with	1
security	1
—	1
ah!	1
that’s	1
the	1
ticket!	1
And	1
such,	1
as	1
everyone	1
knows,	1
is	1
fit	1
accompaniment	1
for	1
a	1
perambulating	1
Forsyte.	1
Amongst	1
these	1
carriages	1
was	1
a	1
barouche	1
coming	1
at	1
a	1
greater	1
pace	1
than	1
the	1
others,	1
drawn	1
by	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
bright	1
bay	1
horses.	1
It	1
swung	1
on	1
its	1
high	1
springs,	1
and	1
the	1
four	1
people	1
who	1
filled	1
it	1
seemed	1
rocked	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
cradle.	1
This	1
chariot	1
attracted	1
young	1
Jolyon’s	1
attention;	1
and	1
suddenly,	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
seat,	1
he	1
recognised	1
his	1
Uncle	1
James,	1
unmistakable	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
increased	1
whiteness	1
of	1
his	1
whiskers;	1
opposite,	1
their	1
backs	1
defended	1
by	1
sunshades,	1
Rachel	1
Forsyte	1
and	1
her	1
elder	1
but	1
married	1
sister,	1
Winifred	1
Dartie,	1
in	1
irreproachable	1
toilettes,	1
had	1
posed	1
their	1
heads	1
haughtily,	1
like	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
birds	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
seeing	1
at	1
the	1
Zoo;	1
while	1
by	1
James’	1
side	1
reclined	1
Dartie,	1
in	1
a	1
brand-new	1
frock-coat	1
buttoned	1
tight	1
and	1
square,	1
with	1
a	1
large	1
expanse	1
of	1
carefully	1
shot	1
linen	1
protruding	1
below	1
each	1
wristband.	1
An	1
extra,	1
if	1
subdued,	1
sparkle,	1
an	1
added	1
touch	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
gloss	1
or	1
varnish	1
characterized	1
this	1
vehicle,	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
distinguish	1
it	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
others,	1
as	1
though	1
by	1
some	1
happy	1
extravagance	1
—	1
like	1
that	1
which	1
marks	1
out	1
the	1
real	1
‘work	1
of	1
art’	1
from	1
the	1
ordinary	1
‘picture’—	1
it	1
were	1
designated	1
as	1
the	1
typical	1
car,	1
the	1
very	1
throne	1
of	1
Forsytedom.	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
them	1
pass;	1
he	1
was	1
petting	1
poor	1
Holly	1
who	1
was	1
tired,	1
but	1
those	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
had	1
taken	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
group;	1
the	1
ladies’	1
heads	1
tilted	1
suddenly,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
spasmodic	1
screening	1
movement	1
of	1
parasols;	1
James’	1
face	1
protruded	1
naively,	1
like	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
a	1
long	1
bird,	1
his	1
mouth	1
slowly	1
opening.	1
The	1
shield-like	1
rounds	1
of	1
the	1
parasols	1
grew	1
smaller	1
and	1
smaller,	1
and	1
vanished.	1
Young	1
Jolyon	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
recognised,	1
even	1
by	1
Winifred,	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
more	1
than	1
fifteen	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
forfeited	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
be	1
considered	1
a	1
Forsyte.	1
There	1
was	1
not	1
much	1
change	1
in	1
them!	1
He	1
remembered	1
the	1
exact	1
look	1
of	1
their	1
turn-out	1
all	1
that	1
time	1
ago:	1
Horses,	1
men,	1
carriage	1
—	1
all	1
different	1
now,	1
no	1
doubt	1
—	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
precise	1
stamp	1
of	1
fifteen	1
years	1
before;	1
the	1
same	1
neat	1
display,	1
the	1
same	1
nicely	1
calculated	1
arrogance	1
ease	1
with	1
security!	1
The	1
swing	1
exact,	1
the	1
pose	1
of	1
the	1
sunshades	1
exact,	1
exact	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
thing.	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
sunlight,	1
defended	1
by	1
the	1
haughty	1
shields	1
of	1
parasols,	1
carriage	1
after	1
carriage	1
went	1
by.	1
“Uncle	1
James	1
has	1
just	1
passed,	1
with	1
his	1
female	1
folk,”	1
said	1
young	1
Jolyon.	1
His	1
father	1
looked	1
black.	1
“Did	1
your	1
uncle	1
see	1
us?	1
Yes?	1
Hmph!	1
What’s	1
he	1
want,	1
coming	1
down	1
into	1
these	1
parts?”	1
An	1
empty	1
cab	1
drove	1
up	1
at	1
this	1
moment,	1
and	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
stopped	1
it.	1
“I	1
shall	1
see	1
you	1
again	1
before	1
long,	1
my	1
boy!”	1
he	1
said.	1
“Don’t	1
you	1
go	1
paying	1
any	1
attention	1
to	1
what	1
I’ve	1
been	1
saying	1
about	1
young	1
Bosinney	1
—	1
I	1
don’t	1
believe	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
it!”	1
Kissing	1
the	1
children,	1
who	1
tried	1
to	1
detain	1
him,	1
he	1
stepped	1
in	1
and	1
was	1
borne	1
away.	1
Young	1
Jolyon,	1
who	1
had	1
taken	1
Holly	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
arms,	1
stood	1
motionless	1
at	1
the	1
corner,	1
looking	1
after	1
the	1
cab.	1
Chapter	1
16	1
Afternoon	1
at	1
Timothy’s	1
If	1
old	1
Jolyon,	1
as	1
he	1
got	1
into	1
his	1
cab,	1
had	1
said:	1
‘I	1
won’t	1
believe	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
it!’	1
he	1
would	1
more	1
truthfully	1
have	1
expressed	1
his	1
sentiments.	1
The	1
notion	1
that	1
James	1
and	1
his	1
womankind	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
his	1
son	1
had	1
awakened	1
in	1
him	1
not	1
only	1
the	1
impatience	1
he	1
always	1
felt	1
when	1
crossed,	1
but	1
that	1
secret	1
hostility	1
natural	1
between	1
brothers,	1
the	1
roots	1
of	1
which	1
—	1
little	1
nursery	1
rivalries	1
—	1
sometimes	1
toughen	1
and	1
deepen	1
as	1
life	1
goes	1
on,	1
and,	1
all	1
hidden,	1
support	1
a	1
plant	1
capable	1
of	1
producing	1
in	1
season	1
the	1
bitterest	1
fruits.	1
Hitherto	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
between	1
these	1
six	1
brothers	1
no	1
more	1
unfriendly	1
feeling	1
than	1
that	1
caused	1
by	1
the	1
secret	1
and	1
natural	1
doubt	1
that	1
the	1
others	1
might	1
be	1
richer	1
than	1
themselves;	1
a	1
feeling	1
increased	1
to	1
the	1
pitch	1
of	1
curiosity	1
by	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
death	1
—	1
that	1
end	1
of	1
all	1
handicaps	1
—	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
‘closeness’	1
of	1
their	1
man	1
of	1
business,	1
who,	1
with	1
some	1
sagacity,	1
would	1
profess	1
to	1
Nicholas	1
ignorance	1
of	1
James’	1
income,	1
to	1
James	1
ignorance	1
of	1
old	1
Jolyon’s,	1
to	1
Jolyon	1
ignorance	1
of	1
Roger’s,	1
to	1
Roger	1
ignorance	1
of	1
Swithin’s,	1
while	1
to	1
Swithin	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
most	1
irritatingly	1
that	1
Nicholas	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
rich	1
man.	1
Timothy	1
alone	1
was	1
exempt,	1
being	1
in	1
gilt-edged	1
securities.	1
But	1
now,	1
between	1
two	1
of	1
them	1
at	1
least,	1
had	1
arisen	1
a	1
very	1
different	1
sense	1
of	1
injury.	1
From	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
James	1
had	1
the	1
impertinence	1
to	1
pry	1
into	1
his	1
affairs	1
—	1
as	1
he	1
put	1
it	1
—	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
no	1
longer	1
chose	1
to	1
credit	1
this	1
story	1
about	1
Bosinney.	1
His	1
grand-daughter	1
slighted	1
through	1
a	1
member	1
of	1
‘that	1
fellow’s’	1
family!	1
He	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
Bosinney	1
was	1
maligned.	1
There	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
other	1
reason	1
for	1
his	1
defection.	1
June	1
had	1
flown	1
out	1
at	1
him,	1
or	1
something;	1
she	1
was	1
as	1
touchy	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
be!	1
He	1
would,	1
however,	1
let	1
Timothy	1
have	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
his	1
mind,	1
and	1
see	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
on	1
dropping	1
hints!	1
And	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
the	1
grass	1
grow	1
under	1
his	1
feet	1
either,	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
there	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
take	1
very	1
good	1
care	1
that	1
he	1
didn’t	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
again	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
errand.	1
He	1
saw	1
James’	1
carriage	1
blocking	1
the	1
pavement	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
‘The	1
Bower.’	1
So	1
they	1
had	1
got	1
there	1
before	1
him	1
—	1
cackling	1
about	1
having	1
seen	1
him,	1
he	1
dared	1
say!	1
And	1
further	1
on,	1
Swithin’s	1
greys	1
were	1
turning	1
their	1
noses	1
towards	1
the	1
noses	1
of	1
James’	1
bays,	1
as	1
though	1
in	1
conclave	1
over	1
the	1
family,	1
while	1
their	1
coachmen	1
were	1
in	1
conclave	1
above.	1
Old	1
Jolyon,	1
depositing	1
his	1
hat	1
on	1
the	1
chair	1
in	1
the	1
narrow	1
hall,	1
where	1
that	1
hat	1
of	1
Bosinney’s	1
had	1
so	1
long	1
ago	1
been	1
mistaken	1
for	1
a	1
cat,	1
passed	1
his	1
thin	1
hand	1
grimly	1
over	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
its	1
great	1
drooping	1
white	1
moustaches,	1
as	1
though	1
to	1
remove	1
all	1
traces	1
of	1
expression,	1
and	1
made	1
his	1
way	1
upstairs.	1
He	1
found	1
the	1
front	1
drawing-room	1
full.	1
It	1
was	1
full	1
enough	1
at	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
times	1
—	1
without	1
visitors	1
—	1
without	1
any	1
one	1
in	1
it	1
—	1
for	1
Timothy	1
and	1
his	1
sisters,	1
following	1
the	1
tradition	1
of	1
their	1
generation,	1
considered	1
that	1
a	1
room	1
was	1
not	1
quite	1
‘nice’	1
unless	1
it	1
was	1
‘properly’	1
furnished.	1
It	1
held,	1
therefore,	1
eleven	1
chairs,	1
a	1
sofa,	1
three	1
tables,	1
two	1
cabinets,	1
innumerable	1
knicknacks,	1
and	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
grand	1
piano.	1
And	1
now,	1
occupied	1
by	1
Mrs.	1
Small,	1
Aunt	1
Hester,	1
by	1
Swithin,	1
James,	1
Rachel,	1
Winifred,	1
Euphemia,	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
in	1
again	1
to	1
return	1
‘Passion	1
and	1
Paregoric’	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
read	1
at	1
lunch,	1
and	1
her	1
chum	1
Frances,	1
Roger’s	1
daughter	1
(the	1
musical	1
Forsyte,	1
the	1
one	1
who	1
composed	1
songs),	1
there	1
was	1
only	1
one	1
chair	1
left	1
unoccupied,	1
except,	1
of	1
course,	1
the	1
two	1
that	1
nobody	1
ever	1
sat	1
on	1
—	1
and	1
the	1
only	1
standing	1
room	1
was	1
occupied	1
by	1
the	1
cat,	1
on	1
whom	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
promptly	1
stepped.	1
In	1
these	1
days	1
it	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
unusual	1
for	1
Timothy	1
to	1
have	1
so	1
many	1
visitors.	1
The	1
family	1
had	1
always,	1
one	1
and	1
all,	1
had	1
a	1
real	1
respect	1
for	1
Aunt	1
Ann,	1
and	1
now	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
gone,	1
they	1
were	1
coming	1
far	1
more	1
frequently	1
to	1
The	1
Bower,	1
and	1
staying	1
longer.	1
Swithin	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
arrive,	1
and	1
seated	1
torpid	1
in	1
a	1
red	1
satin	1
chair	1
with	1
a	1
gilt	1
back,	1
he	1
gave	1
every	1
appearance	1
of	1
lasting	1
the	1
others	1
out.	1
And	1
symbolizing	1
Bosinney’s	1
name	1
‘the	1
big	1
one,’	1
with	1
his	1
great	1
stature	1
and	1
bulk,	1
his	1
thick	1
white	1
hair,	1
his	1
puffy	1
immovable	1
shaven	1
face,	1
he	1
looked	1
more	1
primeval	1
than	1
ever	1
in	1
the	1
highly	1
upholstered	1
room.	1
His	1
conversation,	1
as	1
usual	1
of	1
late,	1
had	1
turned	1
at	1
once	1
upon	1
Irene,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
lost	1
no	1
time	1
in	1
giving	1
Aunts	1
Juley	1
and	1
Hester	1
his	1
opinion	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
this	1
rumour	1
he	1
heard	1
was	1
going	1
about.	1
No	1
—	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
—	1
she	1
might	1
want	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
flirtation	1
—	1
a	1
pretty	1
woman	1
must	1
have	1
her	1
fling;	1
but	1
more	1
than	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
believe.	1
Nothing	1
open;	1
she	1
had	1
too	1
much	1
good	1
sense,	1
too	1
much	1
proper	1
appreciation	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
due	1
to	1
her	1
position,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
family!	1
No	1
sc	1
.	2
.,	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
say	1
‘scandal’	1
but	1
the	1
very	1
idea	1
was	1
so	1
preposterous	1
that	1
he	1
waved	1
his	1
hand	1
as	1
though	1
to	1
say	1
—‘but	1
let	1
that	1
pass!’	1
Granted	1
that	1
Swithin	1
took	1
a	1
bachelor’s	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
situation	1
—	1
still	1
what	1
indeed	1
was	1
not	1
due	1
to	1
that	1
family	1
in	1
which	1
so	1
many	1
had	1
done	1
so	1
well	1
for	1
themselves,	1
had	1
attained	1
a	1
certain	1
position?	1
If	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
in	1
dark,	1
pessimistic	1
moments	1
the	1
words	1
‘yeomen’	1
and	1
‘very	1
small	1
beer’	1
used	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
his	1
origin,	1
did	1
he	1
believe	1
them?	1
No!	1
he	1
cherished,	1
hugging	1
it	1
pathetically	1
to	1
his	1
bosom	1
the	1
secret	1
theory	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
distinguished	1
somewhere	1
in	1
his	1
ancestry.	1
“Must	1
be,”	1
he	1
once	1
said	1
to	1
young	1
Jolyon,	1
before	1
the	1
latter	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
bad.	1
“Look	1
at	1
us,	1
we’ve	1
got	1
on!	1
There	1
must	1
be	1
good	1
blood	1
in	1
us	1
somewhere.”	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
fond	1
of	1
young	1
Jolyon:	1
the	1
boy	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
set	1
at	1
College,	1
had	1
known	1
that	1
old	1
ruffian	1
Sir	1
Charles	1
Fiste’s	1
sons	1
—	1
a	1
pretty	1
rascal	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
turned	1
out,	1
too;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
style	1
about	1
him	1
—	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
thousand	1
pities	1
he	1
had	1
run	1
off	1
with	1
that	1
half-foreign	1
governess!	1
If	1
he	1
must	1
go	1
off	1
like	1
that	1
why	1
couldn’t	1
he	1
have	1
chosen	1
someone	1
who	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
them	1
credit!	1
And	1
what	1
was	1
he	1
now?	1
—	1
an	1
underwriter	1
at	1
Lloyd’s;	1
they	1
said	1
he	1
even	1
painted	1
pictures	1
—	1
pictures!	1
Damme!	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
ended	1
as	1
Sir	1
Jolyon	1
Forsyte,	1
Bart.,	1
with	1
a	1
seat	1
in	1
Parliament,	1
and	1
a	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
country!	1
It	1
was	1
Swithin	1
who,	1
following	1
the	1
impulse	1
which	1
sooner	1
or	1
later	1
urges	1
thereto	1
some	1
member	1
of	1
every	1
great	1
family,	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
Heralds’	1
Office,	1
where	1
they	1
assured	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
undoubtedly	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
family	1
as	1
the	1
well-known	1
Forsites	1
with	1
an	1
‘i,’	1
whose	1
arms	1
were	1
‘three	1
dexter	1
buckles	1
on	1
a	1
sable	1
ground	1
gules,’	1
hoping	1
no	1
doubt	1
to	1
get	1
him	1
to	1
take	1
them	1
up.	1
Swithin,	1
however,	1
did	1
not	1
do	1
this,	1
but	1
having	1
ascertained	1
that	1
the	1
crest	1
was	1
a	1
‘pheasant	1
proper,’	1
and	1
the	1
motto	1
‘For	1
Forsite,’	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
pheasant	1
proper	1
placed	1
upon	1
his	1
carriage	1
and	1
the	1
buttons	1
of	1
his	1
coachman,	1
and	1
both	1
crest	1
and	1
motto	1
on	1
his	1
writing-paper.	1
The	1
arms	1
he	1
hugged	1
to	1
himself,	1
partly	1
because,	1
not	1
having	1
paid	1
for	1
them,	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
would	1
look	1
ostentatious	1
to	1
put	1
them	1
on	1
his	1
carriage,	1
and	1
he	1
hated	1
ostentation,	1
and	1
partly	1
because	1
he,	1
like	1
any	1
practical	1
man	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
country,	1
had	1
a	1
secret	1
dislike	1
and	1
contempt	1
for	1
things	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
he	1
found	1
it	1
hard,	1
as	1
anyone	1
might,	1
to	1
swallow	1
‘three	1
dexter	1
buckles	1
on	1
a	1
sable	1
ground	1
gules.’	1
He	1
never	1
forgot,	1
however,	1
their	1
having	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
paid	1
for	1
them	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
entitled	1
to	1
use	1
them,	1
and	1
it	1
strengthened	1
his	1
conviction	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
gentleman.	1
Imperceptibly	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
absorbed	1
the	1
‘pheasant	1
proper,’	1
and	1
some,	1
more	1
serious	1
than	1
others,	1
adopted	1
the	1
motto;	1
old	1
Jolyon,	1
however,	1
refused	1
to	1
use	1
the	1
latter,	1
saying	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
humbug	1
meaning	1
nothing,	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
see.	1
Among	1
the	1
older	1
generation	1
it	1
was	1
perhaps	1
known	1
at	1
bottom	1
from	1
what	1
great	1
historical	1
event	1
they	1
derived	1
their	1
crest;	1
and	1
if	1
pressed	1
on	1
the	1
subject,	1
sooner	1
than	1
tell	1
a	1
lie	1
—	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
telling	1
lies,	1
having	1
an	1
impression	1
that	1
only	1
Frenchmen	1
and	1
Russians	1
told	1
them	1
—	1
they	1
would	1
confess	1
hurriedly	1
that	1
Swithin	1
had	1
got	1
hold	1
of	1
it	1
somehow.	1
Among	1
the	1
younger	1
generation	1
the	1
matter	1
was	1
wrapped	1
in	1
a	1
discretion	1
proper.	1
They	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
hurt	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
their	1
elders,	1
nor	1
to	1
feel	1
ridiculous	1
themselves;	1
they	1
simply	1
used	1
the	1
crest.	1
.	3
“No,”	1
said	1
Swithin,	1
“he	1
had	2
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
seeing	1
for	1
himself,	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
should	1
say	1
was,	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
in	1
her	1
manner	1
to	1
that	1
young	1
Buccaneer	1
or	1
Bosinney	1
or	1
whatever	1
his	1
name	1
was,	1
different	1
from	1
her	1
manner	1
to	1
himself;	1
in	1
fact,	1
he	1
should	1
rather	1
say.	1
.	3
”	1
But	1
here	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
Frances	1
and	1
Euphemia	1
put	1
an	1
unfortunate	1
stop	1
to	1
the	1
conversation,	1
for	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
subject	1
which	1
could	1
be	1
discussed	1
before	1
young	1
people.	1
And	1
though	1
Swithin	1
was	1
somewhat	1
upset	1
at	1
being	1
stopped	1
like	1
this	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
saying	1
something	1
important,	1
he	1
soon	1
recovered	1
his	1
affability.	1
He	1
was	1
rather	1
fond	1
of	1
Frances	1
—	1
Francie,	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
called	1
in	1
the	1
family.	1
She	1
was	1
so	1
smart,	1
and	1
they	1
told	1
him	1
she	1
made	1
a	1
pretty	1
little	1
pot	1
of	1
pin-money	1
by	1
her	1
songs;	1
he	1
called	1
it	1
very	1
clever	1
of	1
her.	1
He	1
rather	1
prided	1
himself	1
indeed	1
on	1
a	1
liberal	1
attitude	1
towards	1
women,	1
not	1
seeing	1
any	1
reason	1
why	1
they	1
shouldn’t	1
paint	1
pictures,	1
or	1
write	1
tunes,	1
or	1
books	1
even,	1
for	1
the	1
matter	1
of	1
that,	1
especially	1
if	1
they	1
could	1
turn	1
a	1
useful	1
penny	1
by	1
it;	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
—	1
kept	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
mischief.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
men!	1
‘Little	1
Francie,’	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
usually	1
called	1
with	1
good-natured	1
contempt,	1
was	1
an	1
important	1
personage,	1
if	1
only	1
as	1
a	1
standing	1
illustration	1
of	1
the	1
attitude	1
of	1
Forsytes	1
towards	1
the	1
Arts.	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
really	1
‘little,’	1
but	1
rather	1
tall,	1
with	1
dark	1
hair	1
for	1
a	1
Forsyte,	1
which,	1
together	1
with	1
a	1
grey	1
eye,	1
gave	1
her	1
what	1
was	1
called	1
‘a	1
Celtic	1
appearance.’	1
She	1
wrote	1
songs	1
with	1
titles	1
like	1
‘Breathing	1
Sighs,’	1
or	1
‘Kiss	1
me,	1
Mother,	1
ere	1
I	1
die,’	1
with	1
a	1
refrain	1
like	1
an	1
anthem:	1
‘Kiss	1
me,	1
Mother,	1
ere	1
I	1
die;	1
Kiss	1
me-kiss	1
me,	1
Mother,	1
ah!	1
Kiss,	1
ah!	1
kiss	1
me	1
e-ere	1
I—	1
Kiss	1
me,	1
Mother,	1
ere	1
I	1
d-d-die!’	1
She	1
wrote	1
the	1
words	1
to	1
them	1
herself,	1
and	1
other	1
poems.	1
In	1
lighter	1
moments	1
she	1
wrote	1
waltzes,	1
one	1
of	1
which,	1
the	1
‘Kensington	1
Coil,’	1
was	1
almost	1
national	1
to	1
Kensington,	1
having	1
a	1
sweet	1
dip	1
in	1
it.	1
It	1
was	1
very	1
original.	1
Then	1
there	1
were	1
her	1
‘Songs	1
for	1
Little	1
People,’	1
at	1
once	1
educational	1
and	1
witty,	1
especially	1
‘Gran’ma’s	1
Porgie,’	1
and	1
that	1
ditty,	1
almost	1
prophetically	1
imbued	1
with	1
the	1
coming	1
Imperial	1
spirit,	1
entitled	1
‘Black	1
Him	1
In	1
His	1
Little	1
Eye.’	1
Any	1
publisher	1
would	1
take	1
these,	1
and	1
reviews	1
like	1
‘High	1
Living,’	1
and	1
the	1
‘Ladies’	1
Genteel	1
Guide’	1
went	1
into	1
raptures	1
over:	1
‘Another	1
of	1
Miss	1
Francie	1
Forsyte’s	1
spirited	1
ditties,	1
sparkling	1
and	1
pathetic.	1
We	1
ourselves	1
were	1
moved	1
to	1
tears	1
and	1
laughter.	1
Miss	1
Forsyte	1
should	1
go	1
far.’	1
With	1
the	1
true	1
instinct	1
of	1
her	1
breed,	1
Francie	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
point	1
of	1
knowing	1
the	1
right	1
people	1
—	1
people	1
who	1
would	1
write	1
about	1
her,	1
and	1
talk	1
about	1
her,	1
and	1
people	1
in	1
Society,	1
too	1
—	1
keeping	1
a	1
mental	1
register	1
of	1
just	1
where	1
to	1
exert	1
her	1
fascinations,	1
and	1
an	1
eye	1
on	1
that	1
steady	1
scale	1
of	1
rising	1
prices,	1
which	1
in	1
her	1
mind’s	1
eye	1
represented	1
the	1
future.	1
In	1
this	1
way	1
she	1
caused	1
herself	1
to	1
be	1
universally	1
respected.	1
Once,	1
at	1
a	1
time	1
when	1
her	1
emotions	1
were	1
whipped	1
by	1
an	1
attachment	1
—	1
for	1
the	1
tenor	1
of	1
Roger’s	1
life,	1
with	1
its	1
whole-hearted	1
collection	1
of	1
house	1
property,	1
had	1
induced	1
in	1
his	1
only	1
daughter	1
a	1
tendency	1
towards	1
passion	1
—	1
she	1
turned	1
to	1
great	1
and	1
sincere	1
work,	1
choosing	1
the	1
sonata	1
form,	1
for	1
the	1
violin.	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
productions	1
that	1
troubled	1
the	1
Forsytes.	1
They	1
felt	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
sell.	1
Roger,	1
who	1
liked	1
having	1
a	1
clever	1
daughter	1
well	1
enough,	1
and	1
often	1
alluded	1
to	1
the	1
amount	1
of	1
pocket-money	1
she	1
made	1
for	1
herself,	1
was	1
upset	1
by	1
this	1
violin	1
sonata.	1
“Rubbish	1
like	1
that!”	1
he	1
called	1
it.	1
Francie	1
had	1
borrowed	1
young	1
Flageoletti	1
from	1
Euphemia,	1
to	1
play	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
at	1
Prince’s	1
Gardens.	1
As	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
fact	1
Roger	1
was	1
right.	1
It	1
was	1
rubbish,	1
but	1
—	1
annoying!	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
rubbish	1
that	1
wouldn’t	1
sell.	1
As	1
every	1
Forsyte	1
knows,	1
rubbish	1
that	1
sells	1
is	1
not	1
rubbish	1
at	1
all	1
—	1
far	1
from	1
it.	1
And	1
yet,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
sound	1
common	1
sense	1
which	1
fixed	1
the	1
worth	1
of	1
art	1
at	1
what	1
it	1
would	1
fetch,	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
Forsytes	1
—	1
Aunt	1
Hester,	1
for	1
instance,	1
who	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
musical	1
—	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
regretting	1
that	1
Francie’s	1
music	1
was	1
not	1
‘classical’;	1
the	1
same	1
with	1
her	1
poems.	1
But	1
then,	1
as	1
Aunt	1
Hester	1
said,	1
they	1
didn’t	1
see	1
any	1
poetry	1
nowadays,	1
all	1
the	1
poems	1
were	1
‘little	1
light	1
things.’	1
There	1
was	1
nobody	1
who	1
could	1
write	1
a	1
poem	1
like	1
‘Paradise	1
Lost,’	1
or	1
‘Childe	1
Harold’;	1
either	1
of	1
which	1
made	1
you	1
feel	1
that	1
you	1
really	1
had	1
read	1
something.	1
Still,	1
it	1
was	1
nice	1
for	1
Francie	1
to	1
have	1
something	1
to	1
occupy	1
her;	1
while	1
other	1
girls	1
were	1
spending	1
money	1
shopping	1
she	1
was	1
making	1
it!	1
And	1
both	1
Aunt	1
Hester	1
and	1
Aunt	1
Juley	1
were	1
always	1
ready	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
the	1
latest	1
story	1
of	1
how	1
Francie	1
had	1
got	1
her	1
price	1
increased.	1
They	1
listened	1
now,	1
together	1
with	1
Swithin,	1
who	1
sat	1
pretending	1
not	1
to,	1
for	1
these	1
young	1
people	1
talked	1
so	1
fast	1
and	1
mumbled	1
so,	1
he	1
never	1
could	1
catch	1
what	1
they	1
said.	1
“And	1
I	1
can’t	1
think,”	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Septimus,	1
“how	1
you	1
do	1
it.	1
I	1
should	1
never	1
have	1
the	1
audacity!”	1
Francie	1
smiled	1
lightly.	1
“I’d	1
much	1
rather	1
deal	1
with	1
a	1
man	1
than	1
a	1
woman.	1
Women	1
are	1
so	1
sharp!”	1
“My	1
dear,”	1
cried	1
Mrs.	1
Small,	1
“I’m	1
sure	1
we’re	1
not.”	1
Euphemia	1
went	1
off	1
into	1
her	1
silent	1
laugh,	1
and,	1
ending	1
with	1
the	1
squeak,	1
said,	1
as	1
though	1
being	1
strangled:	1
“Oh,	1
you’ll	1
kill	1
me	1
some	1
day,	1
auntie.”	1
Swithin	1
saw	1
no	1
necessity	1
to	1
laugh;	1
he	1
detested	1
people	1
laughing	1
when	1
he	1
himself	1
perceived	1
no	1
joke.	1
Indeed,	1
he	1
detested	1
Euphemia	1
altogether,	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
always	1
alluded	1
as	1
‘Nick’s	1
daughter,	1
what’s	1
she	1
called	1
—	1
the	1
pale	1
one?’	1
He	1
had	1
just	1
missed	1
being	1
her	1
god-father	1
—	1
indeed,	1
would	1
have	1
been,	1
had	1
he	1
not	1
taken	1
a	1
firm	1
stand	1
against	1
her	1
outlandish	1
name.	1
He	1
hated	1
becoming	1
a	1
godfather.	1
Swithin	1
then	1
said	1
to	1
Francie	1
with	1
dignity:	1
“It’s	1
a	1
fine	1
day	1
—	1
er	1
—	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
year.”	1
But	1
Euphemia,	1
who	1
knew	1
perfectly	1
well	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
refused	1
to	1
be	1
her	1
godfather,	1
turned	1
to	1
Aunt	1
Hester,	1
and	1
began	1
telling	1
her	1
how	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
Irene	1
—	1
Mrs.	1
Soames	1
—	1
at	1
the	1
Church	1
and	1
Commercial	1
Stores.	1
“And	1
Soames	1
was	1
with	1
her?”	1
said	1
Aunt	1
Hester,	1
to	1
whom	1
Mrs.	1
Small	1
had	1
as	1
yet	1
had	1
no	1
opportunity	1
of	1
relating	1
the	1
incident.	1
“Soames	1
with	1
her?	1
Of	1
course	1
not!”	1
“But	1
was	1
she	1
all	1
alone	1
in	1
London?”	1
“Oh,	1
no;	1
there	1
was	1
Mr.	1
Bosinney	1
with	1
her.	1
She	1
was	1
perfectly	1
dressed.”	1
But	1
Swithin,	1
hearing	1
the	1
name	1
Irene,	1
looked	1
severely	1
at	1
Euphemia,	1
who,	1
it	1
is	1
true,	1
never	1
did	1
look	1
well	1
in	1
a	1
dress,	1
whatever	1
she	1
may	1
have	1
done	1
on	1
other	1
occasions,	1
and	1
said:	1
“Dressed	1
like	1
a	1
lady,	1
I’ve	1
no	1
doubt.	1
It’s	1
a	1
pleasure	1
to	1
see	1
her.”	1
At	1
this	1
moment	1
James	1
and	1
his	1
daughters	1
were	1
announced.	1
Dartie,	1
feeling	1
badly	1
in	1
want	1
of	1
a	1
drink,	1
had	1
pleaded	1
an	1
appointment	1
with	1
his	1
dentist,	1
and,	1
being	1
put	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
Marble	1
Arch,	1
had	1
got	1
into	1
a	1
hansom,	1
and	1
was	1
already	1
seated	1
in	1
the	1
window	1
of	1
his	1
club	1
in	1
Piccadilly.	1
His	1
wife,	1
he	1
told	1
his	1
cronies,	1
had	1
wanted	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
to	1
pay	1
some	1
calls.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
his	1
line	1
—	1
not	1
exactly.	1
Haw!	1
Hailing	1
the	1
waiter,	1
he	1
sent	1
him	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
hall	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
had	1
won	1
the	1
4.30	1
race.	1
He	1
was	1
dog-tired,	1
he	1
said,	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
a	1
fact;	1
had	1
been	1
drivin’	1
about	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
to	1
‘shows’	1
all	1
the	1
afternoon.	1
Had	1
put	1
his	1
foot	1
down	1
at	1
last.	1
A	1
fellow	1
must	1
live	1
his	1
own	1
life.	1
At	1
this	1
moment,	1
glancing	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
bay	1
window	1
—	1
for	1
he	1
loved	1
this	1
seat	1
whence	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
everybody	1
pass	1
—	1
his	1
eye	1
unfortunately,	1
or	1
perhaps	1
fortunately,	1
chanced	1
to	1
light	1
on	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
Soames,	1
who	1
was	1
mousing	1
across	1
the	1
road	1
from	1
the	1
Green	1
Park-side,	1
with	1
the	1
evident	1
intention	1
of	1
coming	1
in,	1
for	1
he,	1
too,	1
belonged	1
to	1
‘The	1
Iseeum.’	1
Dartie	1
sprang	1
to	1
his	1
feet;	1
grasping	1
his	1
glass,	1
he	1
muttered	1
something	1
about	1
‘that	1
4.30	1
race,’	1
and	1
swiftly	1
withdrew	1
to	1
the	1
card-room,	1
where	1
Soames	1
never	1
came.	1
Here,	1
in	1
complete	1
isolation	1
and	1
a	1
dim	1
light,	1
he	1
lived	1
his	1
own	1
life	1
till	1
half	1
past	1
seven,	1
by	1
which	1
hour	1
he	1
knew	1
Soames	1
must	1
certainly	1
have	1
left	1
the	1
club.	1
It	1
would	1
not	1
do,	1
as	1
he	1
kept	1
repeating	1
to	1
himself	1
whenever	1
he	1
felt	1
the	1
impulse	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
gossips	1
in	1
the	1
bay-window	1
getting	1
too	1
strong	1
for	1
him	1
—	1
it	1
absolutely	1
would	1
not	1
do,	1
with	1
finances	1
as	1
low	1
as	1
his,	1
and	1
the	1
‘old	1
man’	1
(James)	1
rusty	1
ever	1
since	1
that	1
business	1
over	1
the	1
oil	1
shares,	1
which	1
was	1
no	1
fault	1
of	1
his,	1
to	1
risk	1
a	1
row	1
with	1
Winifred.	1
If	1
Soames	1
were	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
club	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
come	1
round	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
he	1
wasn’t	1
at	1
the	1
dentist’s	1
at	1
all.	1
He	1
never	1
knew	1
a	1
family	1
where	1
things	1
‘came	1
round’	1
so.	1
Uneasily,	1
amongst	1
the	1
green	1
baize	1
card-tables,	1
a	1
frown	1
on	1
his	1
olive	1
coloured	1
face,	1
his	1
check	1
trousers	1
crossed,	1
and	1
patent-leather	1
boots	1
shining	1
through	1
the	1
gloom,	1
he	1
sat	1
biting	1
his	1
forefinger,	1
and	1
wondering	1
where	1
the	1
deuce	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
money	1
if	1
Erotic	1
failed	1
to	1
win	1
the	1
Lancashire	1
Cup.	1
His	1
thoughts	1
turned	1
gloomily	1
to	1
the	1
Forsytes.	1
What	1
a	1
set	1
they	1
were!	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
getting	1
anything	1
out	1
of	1
them	1
—	1
at	1
least,	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
extreme	1
difficulty.	1
They	1
were	1
so	1
d	1
—-d	1
particular	1
about	1
money	1
matters;	1
not	1
a	1
sportsman	1
amongst	1
the	1
lot,	1
unless	1
it	1
were	1
George.	1
That	1
fellow	1
Soames,	1
for	1
instance,	1
would	1
have	1
a	1
ft	1
if	1
you	1
tried	1
to	1
borrow	1
a	1
tenner	1
from	1
him,	1
or,	1
if	1
he	1
didn’t	1
have	1
a	1
fit,	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
you	1
with	1
his	1
cursed	1
supercilious	1
smile,	1
as	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
a	1
lost	1
soul	1
because	1
you	1
were	1
in	1
want	1
of	1
money.	1
And	1
that	1
wife	1
of	1
his	1
(Dartie’s	1
mouth	1
watered	1
involuntarily),	1
he	1
had	1
tried	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
good	1
terms	1
with	1
her,	1
as	1
one	1
naturally	1
would	1
with	1
any	1
pretty	1
sister-in-law,	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
cursed	1
if	1
the	1
(he	1
mentally	1
used	1
a	1
coarse	1
word)—	1
would	1
have	1
anything	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
—	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
him,	1
indeed,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
dirt	1
—	1
and	1
yet	1
she	1
could	1
go	1
far	1
enough,	1
he	1
wouldn’t	1
mind	1
betting.	1
He	1
knew	1
women;	1
they	1
weren’t	1
made	1
with	1
soft	1
eyes	1
and	1
figures	1
like	1
that	1
for	1
nothing,	1
as	1
that	1
fellow	1
Soames	1
would	1
jolly	1
soon	1
find	1
out,	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
anything	1
in	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
about	1
this	1
Buccaneer	1
Johnny.	1
Rising	1
from	1
his	1
chair,	1
Dartie	1
took	1
a	1
turn	1
across	1
the	1
room,	1
ending	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
looking-glass	1
over	1
the	1
marble	1
chimney-piece;	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
stood	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
contemplating	1
in	1
the	1
glass	1
the	1
reflection	1
of	1
his	1
face.	1
It	1
had	1
that	1
look,	1
peculiar	1
to	1
some	1
men,	1
of	1
having	1
been	1
steeped	1
in	1
linseed	1
oil,	1
with	1
its	1
waxed	1
dark	1
moustaches	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
distinguished	1
commencements	1
of	1
side	1
whiskers;	1
and	1
concernedly	1
he	1
felt	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
a	1
pimple	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
slightly	1
curved	1
and	1
fattish	1
nose.	1
In	1
the	1
meantime	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
had	1
found	1
the	1
remaining	1
chair	1
in	1
Timothy’s	1
commodious	1
drawing-room.	1
His	1
advent	1
had	1
obviously	1
put	1
a	1
stop	1
to	1
the	1
conversation,	1
decided	1
awkwardness	1
having	1
set	1
in.	1
Aunt	1
Juley,	1
with	1
her	1
well-known	1
kindheartedness,	1
hastened	1
to	1
set	1
people	1
at	1
their	1
ease	1
again.	1
“Yes,	1
Jolyon,”	1
she	1
said,	1
“we	1
were	1
just	1
saying	1
that	1
you	1
haven’t	1
been	1
here	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time;	1
but	1
we	1
mustn’t	1
be	1
surprised.	1
You’re	1
busy,	1
of	1
course?	1
James	1
was	1
just	1
saying	1
what	1
a	1
busy	1
time	1
of	1
year.	1
.	3
”	1
“Was	1
he?”	1
said	1
old	1
Jolyon,	1
looking	1
hard	1
at	1
James.	1
“It	1
wouldn’t	1
be	1
half	1
so	1
busy	1
if	1
everybody	1
minded	1
their	1
own	1
business.”	1
James,	1
brooding	1
in	1
a	1
small	1
chair	1
from	1
which	1
his	1
knees	1
ran	1
uphill,	1
shifted	1
his	1
feet	1
uneasily,	1
and	1
put	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
cat,	1
which	1
had	1
unwisely	1
taken	1
refuge	1
from	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
beside	1
him.	1
“Here,	1
you’ve	1
got	1
a	1
cat	1
here,”	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
an	1
injured	1
voice,	1
withdrawing	1
his	1
foot	1
nervously	1
as	1
he	1
felt	1
it	1
squeezing	1
into	1
the	1
soft,	1
furry	1
body.	1
“Several,”	1
said	1
old	1
Jolyon,	1
looking	1
at	1
one	1
face	1
and	1
another;	1
“I	1
trod	1
on	1
one	1
just	1
now.”	1
A	1
silence	1
followed.	1
Then	1
Mrs.	1
Small,	1
twisting	1
her	1
fingers	1
and	1
gazing	1
round	1
with	1
‘pathetic	1
calm’,	1
asked:	1
“And	1
how	1
is	1
dear	1
June?”	1
A	1
twinkle	1
of	1
humour	1
shot	1
through	1
the	1
sternness	1
of	1
old	1
Jolyon’s	1
eyes.	1
Extraordinary	1
old	1
woman,	1
Juley!	1
No	1
one	1
quite	1
like	1
her	1
for	1
saying	1
the	1
wrong	1
thing!	1
“Bad!”	1
he	1
said;	1
“London	1
don’t	1
agree	1
with	1
her	1
—	1
too	1
many	1
people	1
about,	1
too	1
much	1
clatter	1
and	1
chatter	1
by	1
half.”	1
He	1
laid	1
emphasis	1
on	1
the	1
words,	1
and	1
again	1
looked	1
James	1
in	1
the	1
face.	1
Nobody	1
spoke.	1
A	1
feeling	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
too	1
dangerous	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
step	1
in	1
any	1
direction,	1
or	1
hazard	1
any	1
remark,	1
had	1
fallen	1
on	1
them	1
all.	1
Something	1
of	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
impending,	1
that	1
comes	1
over	1
the	1
spectator	1
of	1
a	1
Greek	1
tragedy,	1
had	1
entered	1
that	1
upholstered	1
room,	1
filled	1
with	1
those	1
white-haired,	1
frock-coated	1
old	1
men,	1
and	1
fashionably	1
attired	1
women,	1
who	1
were	1
all	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
blood,	1
between	1
all	1
of	1
whom	1
existed	1
an	1
unseizable	1
resemblance.	1
Not	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
conscious	1
of	1
it	1
—	1
the	1
visits	1
of	1
such	1
fateful,	1
bitter	1
spirits	1
are	1
only	1
felt.	1
Then	1
Swithin	1
rose.	1
He	1
would	1
not	1
sit	1
there,	1
feeling	1
like	1
that	1
—	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
down	1
by	1
anyone!	1
And,	1
manoeuvring	1
round	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
added	1
pomp,	1
he	1
shook	1
hands	1
with	1
each	1
separately.	1
“You	1
tell	1
Timothy	1
from	1
me,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“that	1
he	1
coddles	1
himself	1
too	1
much!”	1
Then,	1
turning	1
to	1
Francie,	1
whom	1
he	1
considered	1
‘smart,’	1
he	1
added:	1
“You	1
come	1
with	1
me	1
for	1
a	1
drive	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
days.”	1
But	1
this	1
conjured	1
up	1
the	1
vision	1
of	1
that	1
other	1
eventful	1
drive	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
much	1
talked	1
about,	1
and	1
he	1
stood	1
quite	1
still	1
for	1
a	1
second,	1
with	1
glassy	1
eyes,	1
as	1
though	1
waiting	1
to	1
catch	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
himself	1
had	1
said;	1
then,	1
suddenly	1
recollecting	1
that	1
he	1
didn’t	1
care	1
a	1
damn,	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
old	1
Jolyon:	1
“Well,	1
good-bye,	1
Jolyon!	1
You	1
shouldn’t	1
go	1
about	1
without	1
an	1
overcoat;	1
you’ll	1
be	1
getting	1
sciatica	1
or	1
something!”	1
And,	1
kicking	1
the	1
cat	1
slightly	1
with	1
the	1
pointed	1
tip	1
of	1
his	1
patent	1
leather	1
boot,	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
huge	1
form	1
away.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
everyone	1
looked	1
secretly	1
at	1
the	1
others,	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
mention	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
‘drive’—	1
the	1
word	1
which	1
had	1
become	1
famous,	1
and	1
acquired	1
an	1
overwhelming	1
importance,	1
as	1
the	1
only	1
official	1
—	1
so	1
to	1
speak	1
—	1
news	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
the	1
vague	1
and	1
sinister	1
rumour	1
clinging	1
to	1
the	1
family	1
tongue.	1
Euphemia,	1
yielding	1
to	1
an	1
impulse,	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
short	1
laugh:	1
“I’m	1
glad	1
Uncle	1
Swithin	1
doesn’t	1
ask	1
me	1
to	1
go	1
for	1
drives.”	1
Mrs.	1
Small,	1
to	1
reassure	1
her	1
and	1
smooth	1
over	1
any	1
little	1
awkwardness	1
the	1
subject	1
might	1
have,	1
replied:	1
“My	1
dear,	1
he	1
likes	1
to	1
take	1
somebody	1
well	1
dressed,	1
who	1
will	1
do	1
him	1
a	1
little	1
credit.	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
forget	1
the	1
drive	1
he	1
took	1
me.	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
experience!”	1
And	1
her	1
chubby	1
round	1
old	1
face	1
was	1
spread	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
with	1
a	1
strange	1
contentment;	1
then	1
broke	1
into	1
pouts,	1
and	1
tears	1
came	1
into	1
her	1
eyes.	1
She	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
that	1
long	1
ago	1
driving	1
tour	1
she	1
had	1
once	1
taken	1
with	1
Septimus	1
Small.	1
James,	1
who	1
had	1
relapsed	1
into	1
his	1
nervous	1
brooding	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
chair,	1
suddenly	1
roused	1
himself:	1
“He’s	1
a	1
funny	1
fellow,	1
Swithin,”	1
he	1
said,	1
but	1
in	1
a	1
half-hearted	1
way.	1
Old	1
Jolyon’s	1
silence,	1
his	1
stern	1
eyes,	1
held	1
them	1
all	1
in	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
paralysis.	1
He	1
was	1
disconcerted	1
himself	1
by	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
words	1
—	1
an	1
effect	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
deepen	1
the	1
importance	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
rumour	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
scotch;	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
still	1
angry.	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
done	1
with	1
them	1
yet	1
—	1
No,	1
no	1
—	1
he	1
would	1
give	1
them	1
another	1
rub	1
or	1
two.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
rub	1
his	1
nieces,	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
quarrel	1
with	1
them	1
—	1
a	1
young	1
and	1
presentable	1
female	1
always	1
appealed	1
to	1
old	1
Jolyon’s	1
clemency	1
—	1
but	1
that	1
fellow	1
James,	1
and,	1
in	1
a	1
less	1
degree	1
perhaps,	1
those	1
others,	1
deserved	1
all	1
they	1
would	1
get.	1
And	1
he,	1
too,	1
asked	1
for	1
Timothy.	1
As	1
though	1
feeling	1
that	1
some	1
danger	1
threatened	1
her	1
younger	1
brother,	1
Aunt	1
Juley	1
suddenly	1
offered	1
him	1
tea:	1
“There	1
it	1
is,”	1
she	1
said,	1
“all	1
cold	1
and	1
nasty,	1
waiting	1
for	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
back	1
drawing	1
room,	1
but	1
Smither	1
shall	1
make	1
you	1
some	1
fresh.”	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
rose:	1
“Thank	1
you,”	1
he	1
said,	1
looking	1
straight	1
at	1
James,	1
“but	1
I’ve	1
no	1
time	1
for	1
tea,	1
and	1
—	1
scandal,	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
it!	1
It’s	1
time	1
I	1
was	1
at	1
home.	1
Good-bye,	1
Julia;	1
good-bye,	1
Hester;	1
good-bye,	1
Winifred.”	1
Without	1
more	1
ceremonious	1
adieux,	1
he	1
marched	1
out.	1
Once	1
again	1
in	1
his	1
cab,	1
his	1
anger	1
evaporated,	1
for	1
so	1
it	1
ever	1
was	1
with	1
his	1
wrath	1
—	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
rapped	1
out,	1
it	1
was	1
gone.	1
Sadness	1
came	1
over	1
his	1
spirit.	1
He	1
had	1
stopped	1
their	1
mouths,	1
maybe,	1
but	1
at	1
what	1
a	1
cost!	1
At	1
the	1
cost	1
of	1
certain	1
knowledge	1
that	1
the	1
rumour	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
resolved	1
not	1
to	1
believe	1
was	1
true.	1
June	1
was	1
abandoned,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
that	1
fellow’s	1
son!	1
He	1
felt	1
it	1
was	1
true,	1
and	1
hardened	1
himself	1
to	1
treat	1
it	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
not;	1
but	1
the	1
pain	1
he	1
hid	1
beneath	1
this	1
resolution	1
began	1
slowly,	1
surely,	1
to	1
vent	1
itself	1
in	1
a	1
blind	1
resentment	1
against	1
James	1
and	1
his	1
son.	1
The	1
six	1
women	1
and	1
one	1
man	1
left	1
behind	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
drawing-room	1
began	1
talking	1
as	1
easily	1
as	1
might	1
be	1
after	1
such	1
an	1
occurrence,	1
for	1
though	1
each	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
knew	1
for	1
a	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
or	1
she	1
never	1
talked	1
scandal,	1
each	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
also	1
knew	1
that	1
the	1
other	1
six	1
did;	1
all	1
were	1
therefore	1
angry	1
and	1
at	1
a	1
loss.	1
James	1
only	1
was	1
silent,	1
disturbed,	1
to	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
his	1
soul.	1
Presently	1
Francie	1
said:	1
“Do	1
you	1
know,	1
I	1
think	1
Uncle	1
Jolyon	1
is	1
terribly	1
changed	1
this	1
last	1
year.	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think,	1
Aunt	1
Hester?”	1
Aunt	1
Hester	1
made	1
a	1
little	1
movement	1
of	1
recoil:	1
“Oh,	1
ask	1
your	1
Aunt	1
Julia!”	1
she	1
said;	1
“I	1
know	1
nothing	1
about	1
it.”	1
No	1
one	1
else	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
assenting,	1
and	1
James	1
muttered	1
gloomily	1
at	1
the	1
floor:	1
“He’s	1
not	1
half	1
the	1
man	1
he	1
was.”	1
“I’ve	1
noticed	1
it	1
a	1
long	1
time,”	1
went	1
on	1
Francie;	1
“he’s	1
aged	1
tremendously.”	1
Aunt	1
Juley	1
shook	1
her	1
head;	1
her	1
face	1
seemed	1
suddenly	1
to	1
have	1
become	1
one	1
immense	1
pout.	1
“Poor	1
dear	1
Jolyon,”	1
she	1
said,	1
“somebody	1
ought	1
to	1
see	1
to	1
it	1
for	1
him!”	1
There	1
was	1
again	1
silence;	1
then,	1
as	1
though	1
in	1
terror	1
of	1
being	1
left	1
solitarily	1
behind,	1
all	1
five	1
visitors	1
rose	1
simultaneously,	1
and	1
took	1
their	1
departure.	1
Mrs.	1
Small,	1
Aunt	1
Hester,	1
and	1
their	1
cat	1
were	1
left	1
once	1
more	1
alone,	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
door	1
closing	1
in	1
the	1
distance	1
announced	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
Timothy.	1
That	1
evening,	1
when	1
Aunt	1
Hester	1
had	1
just	1
got	1
off	1
to	1
sleep	1
in	1
the	1
back	1
bedroom	1
that	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
Aunt	1
Juley’s	1
before	1
Aunt	1
Juley	1
took	1
Aunt	1
Ann’s,	1
her	1
door	1
was	1
opened,	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Small,	1
in	1
a	1
pink	1
night-cap,	1
a	1
candle	1
in	1
her	1
hand,	1
entered:	1
“Hester!”	1
she	1
said.	1
“Hester!”	1
Aunt	1
Hester	1
faintly	1
rustled	1
the	1
sheet.	1
“Hester,”	1
repeated	1
Aunt	1
Juley,	1
to	1
make	1
quite	1
sure	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
awakened	1
her,	1
“I	1
am	1
quite	1
troubled	1
about	1
poor	1
dear	1
Jolyon.	1
What,”	1
Aunt	1
Juley	1
dwelt	1
on	1
the	1
word,	1
“do	1
you	1
think	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
done?”	1
Aunt	1
Hester	1
again	1
rustled	1
the	1
sheet,	1
her	1
voice	1
was	1
heard	1
faintly	1
pleading:	1
“Done?	1
How	1
should	1
I	1
know?”	1
Aunt	1
Juley	1
turned	1
away	1
satisfied,	1
and	1
closing	1
the	1
door	1
with	1
extra	1
gentleness	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
disturb	1
dear	1
Hester,	1
let	1
it	1
slip	1
through	1
her	1
fingers	1
and	1
fall	1
to	1
with	1
a	1
‘crack.’	1
Back	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
room,	1
she	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
moon	1
over	1
the	1
trees	1
in	1
the	1
Park,	1
through	1
a	1
chink	1
in	1
the	1
muslin	1
curtains,	1
close	1
drawn	1
lest	1
anyone	1
should	1
see.	1
And	1
there,	1
with	1
her	1
face	1
all	1
round	1
and	1
pouting	1
in	1
its	1
pink	1
cap,	1
and	1
her	1
eyes	1
wet,	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
‘dear	1
Jolyon,’	1
so	1
old	1
and	1
so	1
lonely,	1
and	1
how	1
she	1
could	1
be	1
of	1
some	1
use	1
to	1
him;	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
would	1
come	1
to	1
love	1
her,	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
loved	1
since	1
—	1
since	1
poor	1
Septimus	1
went	1
away.	1
Chapter	1
17	1
Dance	1
at	1
Roger’s	2
house	1
in	1
Prince’s	1
Gardens	1
was	1
brilliantly	1
alight.	1
Large	1
numbers	1
of	1
wax	1
candles	1
had	1
been	1
collected	1
and	1
placed	1
in	1
cut-glass	1
chandeliers,	1
and	1
the	1
parquet	1
floor	1
of	1
the	1
long,	1
double	1
drawing-room	1
reflected	1
these	1
constellations.	1
An	1
appearance	1
of	1
real	1
spaciousness	1
had	1
been	1
secured	1
by	1
moving	1
out	1
all	1
the	1
furniture	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
upper	1
landings,	1
and	1
enclosing	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
those	1
strange	1
appendages	1
of	1
civilization	1
known	1
as	1
‘rout’	1
seats.	1
In	1
a	1
remote	1
corner,	1
embowered	1
in	1
palms,	1
was	1
a	1
cottage	1
piano,	1
with	1
a	1
copy	1
of	1
the	1
‘Kensington	1
Coil’	1
open	1
on	1
the	1
music-stand.	1
Roger	1
had	1
objected	1
to	1
a	1
band.	1
He	1
didn’t	1
see	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
what	1
they	1
wanted	1
with	1
a	1
band;	1
he	1
wouldn’t	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
expense,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
it.	1
Francie	1
(her	1
mother,	1
whom	1
Roger	1
had	1
long	1
since	1
reduced	1
to	1
chronic	1
dyspepsia,	1
went	1
to	1
bed	1
on	1
such	1
occasions),	1
had	1
been	1
obliged	1
to	1
content	1
herself	1
with	1
supplementing	1
the	1
piano	1
by	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
who	1
played	1
the	1
cornet,	1
and	1
she	1
so	1
arranged	1
with	1
palms	1
that	1
anyone	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
into	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
things	1
might	1
imagine	1
there	1
were	1
several	1
musicians	1
secreted	1
there.	1
She	1
made	1
up	1
her	1
mind	1
to	1
tell	1
them	1
to	1
play	1
loud	1
—	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
music	1
in	1
a	1
cornet,	1
if	1
the	1
man	1
would	1
only	1
put	1
his	1
soul	1
into	1
it.	1
In	1
the	1
more	1
cultivated	1
American	1
tongue,	1
she	1
was	1
‘through’	1
at	1
last	1
—	1
through	1
that	1
tortuous	1
labyrinth	1
of	1
make-shifts,	1
which	1
must	1
be	1
traversed	1
before	1
fashionable	1
display	1
can	1
be	1
combined	1
with	1
the	1
sound	1
economy	1
of	1
a	1
Forsyte.	1
Thin	1
but	1
brilliant,	1
in	1
her	1
maize-coloured	1
frock	1
with	1
much	1
tulle	1
about	1
the	1
shoulders,	1
she	1
went	1
from	1
place	1
to	1
place,	1
fitting	1
on	1
her	1
gloves,	1
and	1
casting	1
her	1
eye	1
over	1
it	1
all.	1
To	1
the	1
hired	1
butler	1
(for	1
Roger	1
only	1
kept	1
maids)	1
she	1
spoke	1
about	1
the	1
wine.	1
Did	1
he	1
quite	1
understand	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Forsyte	1
wished	1
a	1
dozen	1
bottles	1
of	1
the	1
champagne	1
from	1
Whiteley’s	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
out?	1
But	1
if	1
that	1
were	1
finished	1
(she	1
did	1
not	1
suppose	1
it	1
would	1
be,	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
ladies	1
would	1
drink	1
water,	1
no	1
doubt),	1
but	1
if	1
it	1
were,	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
champagne	1
cup,	1
and	1
he	1
must	1
do	1
the	1
best	1
he	1
could	1
with	1
that.	1
She	1
hated	1
having	1
to	1
say	1
this	1
sort	1
of	1
thing	1
to	1
a	1
butler,	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
infra	1
dig.;	1
but	1
what	1
could	1
you	1
do	1
with	1
father?	1
Roger,	1
indeed,	1
after	1
making	1
himself	1
consistently	1
disagreeable	1
about	1
the	1
dance,	1
would	1
come	1
down	1
presently,	1
with	1
his	1
fresh	1
colour	1
and	1
bumpy	1
forehead,	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
its	1
promoter;	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
smile,	1
and	1
probably	1
take	1
the	1
prettiest	1
woman	1
in	1
to	1
supper;	1
and	1
at	1
two	1
o’clock,	1
just	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
getting	1
into	1
the	1
swing,	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
up	1
secretly	1
to	1
the	1
musicians	1
and	1
tell	1
them	1
to	1
play	1
‘God	1
Save	1
the	1
Queen,’	1
and	1
go	1
away.	1
Francie	1
devoutly	1
hoped	1
he	1
might	1
soon	1
get	1
tired,	1
and	1
slip	1
off	1
to	1
bed.	1
The	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
devoted	1
girl	1
friends	1
who	1
were	1
staying	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
for	1
this	1
dance	1
had	1
partaken	1
with	1
her,	1
in	1
a	1
small,	1
abandoned	1
room	1
upstairs,	1
of	1
tea	1
and	1
cold	1
chicken-legs,	1
hurriedly	1
served;	1
the	1
men	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
out	1
to	1
dine	1
at	1
Eustace’s	1
Club,	1
it	1
being	1
felt	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
be	1
fed	1
up.	1
Punctually	1
on	1
the	1
stroke	1
of	1
nine	1
arrived	1
Mrs.	1
Small	1
alone.	1
She	1
made	1
elaborate	1
apologies	1
for	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
Timothy,	1
omitting	1
all	1
mention	1
of	1
Aunt	1
Hester,	1
who,	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
minute,	1
had	1
said	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
bothered.	1
Francie	1
received	1
her	1
effusively,	1
and	1
placed	1
her	1
on	1
a	1
rout	1
seat,	1
where	1
she	1
left	1
her,	1
pouting	1
and	1
solitary	1
in	1
lavender-coloured	1
satin	1
—	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
she	1
had	1
worn	1
colour	1
since	1
Aunt	1
Ann’s	1
death.	1
The	1
devoted	1
maiden	1
friends	1
came	1
now	1
from	1
their	1
rooms,	1
each	1
by	1
magic	1
arrangement	1
in	1
a	1
differently	1
coloured	1
frock,	1
but	1
all	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
liberal	1
allowance	1
of	1
tulle	1
on	1
the	1
shoulders	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
bosom	1
—	1
for	1
they	1
were,	1
by	1
some	1
fatality,	1
lean	1
to	1
a	1
girl.	1
They	1
were	1
all	1
taken	1
up	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Small.	1
None	1
stayed	1
with	1
her	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
few	1
seconds,	1
but	1
clustering	1
together	1
talked	1
and	1
twisted	1
their	1
programmes,	1
looking	1
secretly	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
appearance	1
of	1
a	1
man.	1
Then	1
arrived	1
in	1
a	1
group	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
Nicholases,	1
always	1
punctual	1
—	1
the	1
fashion	1
up	1
Ladbroke	1
Grove	1
way;	1
and	1
close	1
behind	1
them	1
Eustace	1
and	1
his	1
men,	1
gloomy	1
and	1
smelling	1
rather	1
of	1
smoke.	1
Three	1
or	1
four	1
of	1
Francie’s	1
lovers	1
now	1
appeared,	1
one	1
after	1
the	1
other;	1
she	1
had	1
made	1
each	1
promise	1
to	1
come	1
early.	1
They	1
were	1
all	1
clean-shaven	1
and	1
sprightly,	1
with	1
that	1
peculiar	1
kind	1
of	1
young-man	1
sprightliness	1
which	1
had	1
recently	1
invaded	1
Kensington;	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
mind	1
each	1
other’s	1
presence	1
in	1
the	1
least,	1
and	1
wore	1
their	1
ties	1
bunching	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
ends,	1
white	1
waistcoats,	1
and	1
socks	1
with	1
clocks.	1
All	1
had	1
handkerchiefs	1
concealed	1
in	1
their	1
cuffs.	1
They	1
moved	1
buoyantly,	1
each	1
armoured	1
in	1
professional	1
gaiety,	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
do	1
great	1
deeds.	1
Their	1
faces	1
when	1
they	1
danced,	1
far	1
from	1
wearing	1
the	1
traditional	1
solemn	1
look	1
of	1
the	1
dancing	1
Englishman,	1
were	1
irresponsible,	1
charming,	1
suave;	1
they	1
bounded,	1
twirling	1
their	1
partners	1
at	1
great	1
pace,	1
without	1
pedantic	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
rhythm	1
of	1
the	1
music.	1
At	1
other	1
dancers	1
they	1
looked	1
with	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
airy	1
scorn	1
—	1
they,	1
the	1
light	1
brigade,	1
the	1
heroes	1
of	1
a	1
hundred	1
Kensington	1
‘hops’—	1
from	1
whom	1
alone	1
could	1
the	1
right	1
manner	1
and	1
smile	1
and	1
step	1
be	1
hoped.	1
After	1
this	1
the	1
stream	1
came	1
fast;	1
chaperones	1
silting	1
up	1
along	1
the	1
wall	1
facing	1
the	1
entrance,	1
the	1
volatile	1
element	1
swelling	1
the	1
eddy	1
in	1
the	1
larger	1
room.	1
Men	1
were	1
scarce,	1
and	1
wallflowers	1
wore	1
their	1
peculiar,	1
pathetic	1
expression,	1
a	1
patient,	1
sourish	1
smile	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
say:	1
“Oh,	1
no!	1
don’t	1
mistake	1
me,	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
coming	1
up	1
to	1
me.	1
I	1
can	1
hardly	1
expect	1
that!”	1
And	1
Francie	1
would	1
plead	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
lovers,	1
or	1
with	1
some	1
callow	1
youth:	1
“Now,	1
to	1
please	1
me,	1
do	1
let	1
me	1
introduce	1
you	1
to	1
Miss	1
Pink;	1
such	1
a	1
nice	1
girl,	1
really!”	1
and	1
she	1
would	1
bring	1
him	1
up,	1
and	1
say:	1
“Miss	1
Pink	1
—	1
Mr.	1
Gathercole.	1
Can	1
you	1
spare	1
him	1
a	1
dance?”	1
Then	1
Miss	1
Pink,	1
smiling	1
her	1
forced	1
smile,	1
colouring	1
a	1
little,	1
answered:	1
“Oh!	1
I	1
think	1
so!”	1
and	1
screening	1
her	1
empty	1
card,	1
wrote	1
on	1
it	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Gathercole,	1
spelling	1
it	1
passionately	1
in	1
the	1
district	1
that	1
he	1
proposed,	1
about	1
the	1
second	1
extra.	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
youth	1
had	1
murmured	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
hot,	1
and	1
passed,	1
she	1
relapsed	1
into	1
her	1
attitude	1
of	1
hopeless	1
expectation,	1
into	1
her	1
patient,	1
sourish	1
smile.	1
Mothers,	1
slowly	1
fanning	1
their	1
faces,	1
watched	1
their	1
daughters,	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
eyes	1
could	1
be	1
read	1
all	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
those	1
daughters’	1
fortunes.	1
As	1
for	1
themselves,	1
to	1
sit	1
hour	1
after	1
hour,	1
dead	1
tired,	1
silent,	1
or	1
talking	1
spasmodically	1
—	1
what	1
did	1
it	1
matter,	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
girls	1
were	1
having	1
a	1
good	1
time!	1
But	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
neglected	1
and	1
passed	1
by!	1
Ah!	1
they	1
smiled,	1
but	1
their	1
eyes	1
stabbed	1
like	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
an	1
offended	1
swan;	1
they	1
longed	1
to	1
pluck	1
young	1
Gathercole	1
by	1
the	1
slack	1
of	1
his	1
dandified	1
breeches,	1
and	1
drag	1
him	1
to	1
their	1
daughters	1
—	1
the	1
jackanapes!	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
cruelties	1
and	1
hardness	1
of	1
life,	1
its	1
pathos	1
and	1
unequal	1
chances,	1
its	1
conceit,	1
self-forgetfulness,	1
and	1
patience,	1
were	1
presented	1
on	1
the	1
battle-field	1
of	1
this	1
Kensington	1
ball-room.	1
Here	1
and	1
there,	1
too,	1
lovers	1
—	1
not	1
lovers	1
like	1
Francie’s,	1
a	1
peculiar	1
breed,	1
but	1
simply	1
lovers	1
—	1
trembling,	1
blushing,	1
silent,	1
sought	1
each	1
other	1
by	1
flying	1
glances,	1
sought	1
to	1
meet	1
and	1
touch	1
in	1
the	1
mazes	1
of	1
the	1
dance,	1
and	1
now	1
and	1
again	1
dancing	1
together,	1
struck	1
some	1
beholder	1
by	1
the	1
light	1
in	1
their	1
eyes.	1
Not	1
a	1
second	1
before	1
ten	1
o’clock	1
came	1
the	1
Jameses	1
—	1
Emily,	1
Rachel,	1
Winifred	1
(Dartie	1
had	1
been	1
left	1
behind,	1
having	1
on	1
a	1
former	1
occasion	1
drunk	1
too	1
much	1
of	1
Roger’s	1
champagne),	1
and	1
Cicely,	1
the	1
youngest,	1
making	1
her	1
debut;	1
behind	1
them,	1
following	1
in	1
a	1
hansom	1
from	1
the	1
paternal	1
mansion	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
dined,	1
Soames	1
and	1
Irene.	1
All	1
these	1
ladies	1
had	1
shoulder-straps	1
and	1
no	1
tulle	1
—	1
thus	1
showing	1
at	1
once,	1
by	1
a	1
bolder	1
exposure	1
of	1
flesh,	1
that	1
they	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
more	1
fashionable	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
Park.	1
Soames,	1
sidling	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
contact	1
of	1
the	1
dancers,	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
position	1
against	1
the	1
wall.	1
Guarding	1
himself	1
with	1
his	1
pale	1
smile,	1
he	1
stood	1
watching.	1
Waltz	1
after	1
waltz	1
began	1
and	1
ended,	1
couple	1
after	1
couple	1
brushed	1
by	1
with	1
smiling	1
lips,	1
laughter,	1
and	1
snatches	1
of	1
talk;	1
or	1
with	1
set	1
lips,	1
and	1
eyes	1
searching	1
the	1
throng;	1
or	1
again,	1
with	1
silent,	1
parted	1
lips,	1
and	1
eyes	1
on	1
each	1
other.	1
And	1
the	1
scent	1
of	1
festivity,	1
the	1
odour	1
of	1
flowers,	1
and	1
hair,	1
of	1
essences	1
that	1
women	1
love,	1
rose	1
suffocatingly	1
in	1
the	1
heat	1
of	1
the	1
summer	1
night.	1
Silent,	1
with	1
something	1
of	1
scorn	1
in	1
his	1
smile,	1
Soames	1
seemed	1
to	1
notice	1
nothing;	1
but	1
now	1
and	1
again	1
his	1
eyes,	1
finding	1
that	1
which	1
they	1
sought,	1
would	1
fix	1
themselves	1
on	1
a	1
point	1
in	1
the	1
shifting	1
throng,	1
and	1
the	1
smile	1
die	1
off	1
his	1
lips.	1
He	1
danced	1
with	1
no	1
one.	1
Some	1
fellows	1
danced	1
with	1
their	1
wives;	1
his	1
sense	1
of	1
‘form’	1
had	1
never	1
permitted	1
him	1
to	1
dance	1
with	1
Irene	1
since	1
their	1
marriage,	1
and	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
the	1
Forsytes	1
alone	1
can	1
tell	1
whether	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
relief	1
to	1
him	1
or	1
not.	1
She	1
passed,	1
dancing	1
with	1
other	1
men,	1
her	1
dress,	1
iris-coloured,	1
floating	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
feet.	1
She	1
danced	1
well;	1
he	1
was	1
tired	1
of	1
hearing	1
women	1
say	1
with	1
an	1
acid	1
smile:	1
“How	1
beautifully	1
your	1
wife	1
dances,	1
Mr.	1
Forsyte	1
—	1
it’s	1
quite	1
a	1
pleasure	1
to	1
watch	1
her!”	1
Tired	1
of	1
answering	1
them	1
with	1
his	1
sidelong	1
glance:	1
“You	1
think	1
so?”	1
A	1
young	1
couple	1
close	1
by	1
flirted	1
a	1
fan	1
by	1
turns,	1
making	1
an	1
unpleasant	1
draught.	1
Francie	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
lovers	1
stood	1
near.	1
They	1
were	1
talking	1
of	1
love.	1
He	1
heard	1
Roger’s	1
voice	1
behind,	1
giving	1
an	1
order	1
about	1
supper	1
to	1
a	1
servant.	1
Everything	1
was	1
very	1
second-class!	1
He	1
wished	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
come!	1
He	1
had	1
asked	1
Irene	1
whether	1
she	1
wanted	1
him;	1
she	1
had	1
answered	1
with	1
that	1
maddening	1
smile	1
of	1
hers	1
“Oh,	1
no!”	1
Why	1
had	1
he	1
come?	1
For	1
the	1
last	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
even	1
seen	1
her.	1
Here	1
was	1
George	1
advancing	1
with	1
his	1
Quilpish	1
face;	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
late	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
way.	1
“Have	1
you	1
seen	1
‘The	1
Buccaneer’?”	1
said	1
this	1
licensed	1
wag;	1
“he’s	1
on	1
the	1
warpath	1
—	1
hair	1
cut	1
and	1
everything!”	1
Soames	1
said	1
he	1
had	1
not,	1
and	1
crossing	1
the	1
room,	1
half-empty	1
in	1
an	1
interval	1
of	1
the	1
dance,	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
balcony,	1
and	1
looked	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
street.	1
A	1
carriage	1
had	1
driven	1
up	1
with	1
late	1
arrivals,	1
and	1
round	1
the	1
door	1
hung	1
some	1
of	1
those	1
patient	1
watchers	1
of	1
the	1
London	1
streets	1
who	1
spring	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
call	1
of	1
light	1
or	1
music;	1
their	1
faces,	1
pale	1
and	1
upturned	1
above	1
their	1
black	1
and	1
rusty	1
figures,	1
had	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
stolid	1
watching	1
that	1
annoyed	1
Soames.	1
Why	1
were	1
they	1
allowed	1
to	1
hang	1
about;	1
why	1
didn’t	1
the	1
bobby	1
move	1
them	1
on?	1
But	1
the	1
policeman	1
took	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
them;	1
his	1
feet	1
were	1
planted	1
apart	1
on	1
the	1
strip	1
of	1
crimson	1
carpet	1
stretched	1
across	1
the	1
pavement;	1
his	1
face,	1
under	1
the	1
helmet,	1
wore	1
the	1
same	1
stolid,	1
watching	1
look	1
as	1
theirs.	1
Across	1
the	1
road,	1
through	1
the	1
railings,	1
Soames	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
branches	1
of	1
trees	1
shining,	1
faintly	1
stirring	1
in	1
the	1
breeze,	1
by	1
the	1
gleam	1
of	1
the	1
street	1
lamps;	1
beyond,	1
again,	1
the	1
upper	1
lights	1
of	1
the	1
houses	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
so	1
many	1
eyes	1
looking	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
quiet	1
blackness	1
of	1
the	1
garden;	1
and	1
over	1
all,	1
the	1
sky,	1
that	1
wonderful	1
London	1
sky,	1
dusted	1
with	1
the	1
innumerable	1
reflection	1
of	1
countless	1
lamps;	1
a	1
dome	1
woven	1
over	1
between	1
its	1
stars	1
with	1
the	1
refraction	1
of	1
human	1
needs	1
and	1
human	1
fancies	1
—	1
immense	1
mirror	1
of	1
pomp	1
and	1
misery	1
that	1
night	1
after	1
night	1
stretches	1
its	1
kindly	1
mocking	1
over	1
miles	1
of	1
houses	1
and	1
gardens,	1
mansions	1
and	1
squalor,	1
over	1
Forsytes,	1
policemen,	1
and	1
patient	1
watchers	1
in	1
the	1
streets.	1
Soames	1
turned	1
away,	1
and,	1
hidden	1
in	1
the	1
recess,	1
gazed	1
into	1
the	1
lighted	1
room.	1
It	1
was	1
cooler	1
out	1
there.	1
He	1
saw	1
the	1
new	1
arrivals,	1
June	1
and	1
her	1
grandfather,	1
enter.	1
What	1
had	1
made	1
them	1
so	1
late?	1
They	1
stood	1
by	1
the	1
doorway.	1
They	1
looked	1
fagged.	1
Fancy	1
Uncle	1
Jolyon	1
turning	1
out	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
of	1
night!	1
Why	1
hadn’t	1
June	1
come	1
to	1
Irene,	1
as	1
she	1
usually	1
did,	1
and	1
it	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
suddenly	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
nothing	1
of	1
June	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
now.	1
Watching	1
her	1
face	1
with	1
idle	1
malice,	1
he	1
saw	1
it	1
change,	1
grow	1
so	1
pale	1
that	1
he	1
thought	1
she	1
would	1
drop,	1
then	1
flame	1
out	1
crimson.	1
Turning	1
to	1
see	1
at	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
looking,	1
he	1
saw	1
his	1
wife	1
on	1
Bosinney’s	1
arm,	1
coming	1
from	1
the	1
conservatory	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
Her	1
eyes	1
were	1
raised	1
to	1
his,	1
as	1
though	1
answering	1
some	1
question	1
he	1
had	1
asked,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
gazing	1
at	1
her	1
intently.	1
Soames	1
looked	1
again	1
at	1
June.	1
Her	1
hand	1
rested	1
on	1
old	1
Jolyon’s	1
arm;	1
she	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
making	1
a	1
request.	1
He	1
saw	1
a	1
surprised	1
look	1
on	1
his	1
uncle’s	1
face;	1
they	1
turned	1
and	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
door	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
sight.	1
The	1
music	1
began	1
again	1
—	1
a	1
waltz	1
—	1
and,	1
still	1
as	1
a	1
statue	1
in	1
the	1
recess	1
of	1
the	1
window,	1
his	1
face	1
unmoved,	1
but	1
no	1
smile	1
on	1
his	1
lips,	1
Soames	1
waited.	1
Presently,	1
within	1
a	1
yard	1
of	1
the	1
dark	1
balcony,	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
Bosinney	1
passed.	1
He	1
caught	1
the	1
perfume	1
of	1
the	1
gardenias	1
that	1
she	1
wore,	1
saw	1
the	1
rise	1
and	1
fall	1
of	1
her	1
bosom,	1
the	1
languor	1
in	1
her	1
eyes,	1
her	1
parted	1
lips,	1
and	1
a	1
look	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know.	1
To	1
the	1
slow,	1
swinging	1
measure	1
they	1
danced	1
by,	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
they	1
clung	1
to	1
each	1
other;	1
he	1
saw	1
her	1
raise	1
her	1
eyes,	1
soft	1
and	1
dark,	1
to	1
Bosinney’s,	1
and	1
drop	1
them	1
again.	1
Very	1
white,	1
he	1
turned	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
balcony,	1
and	1
leaning	1
on	1
it,	1
gazed	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
Square;	1
the	1
figures	1
were	1
still	1
there	1
looking	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
light	1
with	1
dull	1
persistency,	1
the	1
policeman’s	1
face,	1
too,	1
upturned,	1
and	1
staring,	1
but	1
he	1
saw	1
nothing	1
of	1
them.	1
Below,	1
a	1
carriage	1
drew	1
up,	1
two	1
figures	1
got	1
in,	1
and	1
drove	1
away.	1
.	3
That	1
evening	1
June	1
and	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
dinner	1
at	1
the	1
usual	1
hour.	1
The	1
girl	1
was	1
in	1
her	1
customary	1
high-necked	1
frock,	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
had	1
not	1
dressed.	1
At	1
breakfast	1
she	1
had	1
spoken	1
of	1
the	1
dance	1
at	1
Uncle	1
Roger’s,	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
go;	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
stupid	1
enough,	1
she	1
said,	1
not	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
asking	1
anyone	1
to	1
take	1
her.	1
It	1
was	1
too	1
late	1
now.	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
lifted	1
his	1
keen	1
eyes.	1
June	1
was	1
used	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
dances	1
with	1
Irene	1
as	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
course!	1
and	1
deliberately	1
fixing	1
his	1
gaze	1
on	1
her,	1
he	1
asked:	1
“Why	1
don’t	1
you	1
get	1
Irene?”	1
No!	1
June	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
ask	1
Irene;	1
she	1
would	1
only	1
go	1
if	1
—	1
if	1
her	1
grandfather	1
wouldn’t	1
mind	1
just	1
for	1
once	1
for	1
a	1
little	1
time!	1
At	1
her	1
look,	1
so	1
eager	1
and	1
so	1
worn,	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
had	1
grumblingly	1
consented.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
she	1
wanted,	1
he	1
said,	1
with	1
going	1
to	1
a	1
dance	1
like	1
this,	1
a	1
poor	1
affair,	1
he	1
would	1
wager;	1
and	1
she	1
no	1
more	1
fit	1
for	1
it	1
than	1
a	1
cat!	1
What	1
she	1
wanted	1
was	1
sea	1
air,	1
and	1
after	1
his	1
general	1
meeting	1
of	1
the	1
Globular	1
Gold	1
Concessions	1
he	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
take	1
her.	1
She	1
didn’t	1
want	1
to	1
go	1
away?	1
Ah!	1
she	1
would	1
knock	1
herself	1
up!	1
Stealing	1
a	1
mournful	1
look	1
at	1
her,	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
breakfast.	1
June	1
went	1
out	1
early,	1
and	1
wandered	1
restlessly	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
heat.	1
Her	1
little	1
light	1
figure	1
that	1
lately	1
had	1
moved	1
so	1
languidly	1
about	1
its	1
business,	1
was	1
all	1
on	1
fire.	1
She	1
bought	1
herself	1
some	1
flowers.	1
She	1
wanted	1
—	1
she	1
meant	1
to	1
look	1
her	1
best.	1
He	1
would	1
be	1
there!	1
She	1
knew	1
well	1
enough	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
card.	1
She	1
would	1
show	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
care.	1
But	1
deep	1
down	1
in	1
her	1
heart	1
she	1
resolved	1
that	1
evening	1
to	1
win	1
him	1
back.	1
She	1
came	1
in	1
flushed,	1
and	1
talked	1
brightly	1
all	1
lunch;	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
was	1
there,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
deceived.	1
In	1
the	1
afternoon	1
she	1
was	1
overtaken	1
by	1
a	1
desperate	1
fit	1
of	1
sobbing.	1
She	1
strangled	1
the	1
noise	1
against	1
the	1
pillows	1
of	1
her	1
bed,	1
but	1
when	1
at	1
last	1
it	1
ceased	1
she	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
glass	1
a	1
swollen	1
face	1
with	1
reddened	1
eyes,	1
and	1
violet	1
circles	1
round	1
them.	1
She	1
stayed	1
in	1
the	1
darkened	1
room	1
till	1
dinner	1
time.	1
All	1
through	1
that	1
silent	1
meal	1
the	1
struggle	1
went	1
on	1
within	1
her.	1
She	1
looked	1
so	1
shadowy	1
and	1
exhausted	1
that	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
told	1
‘Sankey’	1
to	1
countermand	1
the	1
carriage,	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
her	1
going	1
out.	1
.	3
She	1
was	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
bed!	1
She	1
made	1
no	1
resistance.	1
She	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
room,	1
and	1
sat	1
in	1
the	1
dark.	1
At	1
ten	1
o’clock	1
she	1
rang	1
for	1
her	1
maid.	1
“Bring	1
some	1
hot	1
water,	1
and	1
go	1
down	1
and	1
tell	1
Mr.	1
Forsyte	1
that	1
I	1
feel	1
perfectly	1
rested.	1
Say	1
that	1
if	1
he’s	1
too	1
tired	1
I	1
can	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
dance	1
by	1
myself.”	1
The	1
maid	1
looked	1
askance,	1
and	1
June	1
turned	1
on	1
her	1
imperiously.	1
“Go,”	1
she	1
said,	1
“bring	1
the	1
hot	1
water	1
at	1
once!”	1
Her	1
ball-dress	1
still	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1
sofa,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
fierce	1
care	1
she	1
arrayed	1
herself,	1
took	1
the	1
flowers	1
in	1
her	1
hand,	1
and	1
went	1
down,	1
her	1
small	1
face	1
carried	1
high	1
under	1
its	1
burden	1
of	1
hair.	1
She	1
could	1
hear	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
in	1
his	1
room	1
as	1
she	1
passed.	1
Bewildered	1
and	1
vexed,	1
he	1
was	1
dressing.	1
It	1
was	1
past	1
ten,	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
get	1
there	1
till	1
eleven;	1
the	1
girl	1
was	1
mad.	1
But	1
he	1
dared	1
not	1
cross	1
her	1
—	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
face	1
at	1
dinner	1
haunted	1
him.	1
With	1
great	1
ebony	1
brushes	1
he	1
smoothed	1
his	1
hair	1
till	1
it	1
shone	1
like	1
silver	1
under	1
the	1
light;	1
then	1
he,	1
too,	1
came	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
gloomy	1
staircase.	1
June	1
met	1
him	1
below,	1
and,	1
without	1
a	1
word,	1
they	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
carriage.	1
When,	1
after	1
that	1
drive	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
last	1
for	1
ever,	1
she	1
entered	1
Roger’s	1
drawing-room,	1
she	1
disguised	1
under	1
a	1
mask	1
of	1
resolution	1
a	1
very	1
torment	1
of	1
nervousness	1
and	1
emotion.	1
The	1
feeling	1
of	1
shame	1
at	1
what	1
might	1
be	1
called	1
‘running	1
after	1
him’	1
was	1
smothered	1
by	1
the	1
dread	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
there,	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
not	1
see	1
him	1
after	1
all,	1
and	1
by	1
that	1
dogged	1
resolve	1
—	1
somehow,	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
—	1
to	1
win	1
him	1
back.	1
The	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
ballroom,	1
with	1
its	1
gleaming	1
floor,	1
gave	1
her	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
joy,	1
of	1
triumph,	1
for	1
she	1
loved	1
dancing,	1
and	1
when	1
dancing	1
she	1
floated,	1
so	1
light	1
was	1
she,	1
like	1
a	1
strenuous,	1
eager	1
little	1
spirit.	1
He	1
would	1
surely	1
ask	1
her	1
to	1
dance,	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
danced	1
with	1
her	1
it	1
would	1
all	1
be	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
before.	1
She	1
looked	1
about	1
her	1
eagerly.	1
The	1
sight	1
of	1
Bosinney	1
coming	1
with	1
Irene	1
from	1
the	1
conservatory,	1
with	1
that	1
strange	1
look	1
of	1
utter	1
absorption	1
on	1
his	1
face,	1
struck	1
her	1
too	1
suddenly.	1
They	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
—	1
no	1
one	1
should	1
see	1
—	1
her	1
distress,	1
not	1
even	1
her	1
grandfather.	1
She	1
put	1
her	1
hand	1
on	1
Jolyon’s	1
arm,	1
and	1
said	1
very	1
low:	1
“I	1
must	1
go	1
home,	1
Gran;	1
I	1
feel	1
ill.”	1
He	1
hurried	1
her	1
away,	1
grumbling	1
to	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
known	1
how	1
it	1
would	1
be.	1
To	1
her	1
he	1
said	1
nothing;	1
only	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
once	1
more	1
in	1
the	1
carriage,	1
which	1
by	1
some	1
fortunate	1
chance	1
had	1
lingered	1
near	1
the	1
door,	1
he	1
asked	1
her:	1
“What	1
is	1
it,	1
my	1
darling?”	1
Feeling	1
her	1
whole	1
slender	1
body	1
shaken	1
by	1
sobs,	1
he	1
was	1
terribly	1
alarmed.	1
She	1
must	1
have	1
Blank	1
to-morrow.	1
He	1
would	1
insist	1
upon	1
it.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
her	1
like	1
this.	1
.	3
There,	1
there!	1
June	1
mastered	1
her	1
sobs,	1
and	1
squeezing	1
his	1
hand	1
feverishly,	1
she	1
lay	1
back	1
in	1
her	1
corner,	1
her	1
face	1
muffled	1
in	1
a	1
shawl.	1
He	1
could	1
only	1
see	1
her	1
eyes,	1
fixed	1
and	1
staring	1
in	1
the	1
dark,	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
cease	1
to	1
stroke	1
her	1
hand	1
with	1
his	1
thin	1
fingers.	1
Chapter	1

Evening	1
at	1
Richmond	1
Other	1
eyes	1
besides	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
June	1
and	1
of	1
Soames	1
had	1
seen	1
‘those	1
two’	1
(as	1
Euphemia	1
had	1
already	1
begun	1
to	1
call	1
them)	1
coming	1
from	1
the	1
conservatory;	1
other	1
eyes	1
had	1
noticed	1
the	1
look	1
on	1
Bosinney’s	1
face.	1
There	1
are	1
moments	1
when	1
Nature	1
reveals	1
the	1
passion	1
hidden	1
beneath	1
the	1
careless	1
calm	1
of	1
her	1
ordinary	1
moods	1
—	1
violent	1
spring	1
flashing	1
white	1
on	1
almond-blossom	1
through	1
the	1
purple	1
clouds;	1
a	1
snowy,	1
moonlit	1
peak,	1
with	1
its	1
single	1
star,	1
soaring	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
passionate	1
blue;	1
or	1
against	1
the	1
flames	1
of	1
sunset,	1
an	1
old	1
yew-tree	1
standing	1
dark	1
guardian	1
of	1
some	1
fiery	1
secret.	1
There	1
are	1
moments,	1
too,	1
when	1
in	1
a	1
picture-gallery,	1
a	1
work,	1
noted	1
by	1
the	1
casual	1
spectator	1
as	1
‘.	1
.	3
..Titian	1
—	1
remarkably	1
fine,’	1
breaks	1
through	1
the	1
defences	1
of	1
some	1
Forsyte	1
better	1
lunched	1
perhaps	1
than	1
his	1
fellows,	1
and	1
holds	1
him	1
spellbound	1
in	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
ecstasy.	1
There	1
are	1
things,	1
he	1
feels	1
—	1
there	1
are	1
things	1
here	1
which	1
—	1
well,	1
which	1
are	1
things.	1
Something	1
unreasoning,	1
unreasonable,	1
is	1
upon	1
him;	1
when	1
he	1
tries	1
to	1
define	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
precision	1
of	1
a	1
practical	1
man,	1
it	1
eludes	1
him,	1
slips	1
away,	1
as	1
the	1
glow	1
of	1
the	1
wine	1
he	1
has	1
drunk	1
is	1
slipping	1
away,	1
leaving	1
him	1
cross,	1
and	1
conscious	1
of	1
his	1
liver.	1
He	1
feels	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
extravagant,	1
prodigal	1
of	1
something;	1
virtue	1
has	1
gone	1
out	1
of	1
him.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
desire	1
this	1
glimpse	1
of	1
what	1
lay	1
under	1
the	1
three	1
stars	1
of	1
his	1
catalogue.	1
God	1
forbid	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
know	1
anything	1
about	1
the	1
forces	1
of	1
Nature!	1
God	1
forbid	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
admit	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
such	1
things!	1
Once	1
admit	1
that,	1
and	1
where	1
was	1
he?	1
One	1
paid	1
a	1
shilling	1
for	1
entrance,	1
and	1
another	1
for	1
the	1
programme.	1
The	1
look	1
which	1
June	1
had	1
seen,	1
which	1
other	1
Forsytes	1
had	1
seen,	1
was	1
like	1
the	1
sudden	1
flashing	1
of	1
a	1
candle	1
through	1
a	1
hole	1
in	1
some	1
imaginary	1
canvas,	1
behind	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
being	1
moved	1
—	1
the	1
sudden	1
flaming-out	1
of	1
a	1
vague,	1
erratic	1
glow,	1
shadowy	1
and	1
enticing.	1
It	1
brought	1
home	1
to	1
onlookers	1
the	1
consciousness	1
that	1
dangerous	1
forces	1
were	1
at	1
work.	1
For	1
a	1
moment	1
they	1
noticed	1
it	1
with	1
pleasure,	1
with	1
interest,	1
then	1
felt	1
they	1
must	1
not	1
notice	1
it	1
at	1
all.	1
It	1
supplied,	1
however,	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
June’s	1
coming	1
so	1
late	1
and	1
disappearing	1
again	1
without	1
dancing,	1
without	1
even	1
shaking	1
hands	1
with	1
her	1
lover.	1
She	1
was	1
ill,	1
it	1
was	1
said,	1
and	1
no	1
wonder.	1
But	1
here	1
they	1
looked	1
at	1
each	1
other	1
guiltily.	1
They	1
had	1
no	1
desire	1
to	1
spread	1
scandal,	1
no	1
desire	1
to	1
be	1
ill-natured.	1
Who	1
would	1
have?	1
And	1
to	1
outsiders	1
no	1
word	1
was	1
breathed,	1
unwritten	1
law	1
keeping	1
them	1
silent.	1
Then	1
came	1
the	1
news	1
that	1
June	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
the	1
seaside	1
with	1
old	1
Jolyon.	1
He	1
had	1
carried	1
her	1
off	1
to	1
Broadstairs,	1
for	1
which	1
place	1
there	1
was	1
just	1
then	1
a	1
feeling,	1
Yarmouth	1
having	1
lost	1
caste,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
Nicholas,	1
and	1
no	1
Forsyte	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
sea	1
without	1
intending	1
to	1
have	1
an	1
air	1
for	1
his	1
money	1
such	1
as	1
would	1
render	1
him	1
bilious	1
in	1
a	1
week.	1
That	1
fatally	1
aristocratic	1
tendency	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
Forsyte	1
to	1
drink	1
Madeira	1
had	1
left	1
his	1
descendants	1
undoubtedly	1
accessible.	1
So	1
June	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
sea.	1
The	1
family	1
awaited	1
developments;	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
else	1
to	1
do.	1
But	1
how	1
far	1
—	1
how	1
far	1
had	1
‘those	1
two’	1
gone?	1
How	1
far	1
were	1
they	1
going	1
to	1
go?	1
Could	1
they	1
really	1
be	1
going	1
at	1
all?	1
Nothing	1
could	1
surely	1
come	1
of	1
it,	1
for	1
neither	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
any	1
money.	1
At	1
the	1
most	1
a	1
flirtation,	1
ending,	1
as	1
all	1
such	1
attachments	1
should,	1
at	1
the	1
proper	1
time.	1
Soames’	1
sister,	1
Winifred	1
Dartie,	1
who	1
had	1
imbibed	1
with	1
the	1
breezes	1
of	1
Mayfair	1
—	1
she	1
lived	1
in	1
Green	1
Street	1
—	1
more	1
fashionable	1
principles	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
matrimonial	1
behaviour	1
than	1
were	1
current,	1
for	1
instance,	1
in	1
Ladbroke	1
Grove,	1
laughed	1
at	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
there	1
being	1
anything	1
in	1
it.	1
The	1
‘little	1
thing’—	1
Irene	1
was	1
taller	1
than	1
herself,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
real	1
testimony	1
to	1
the	1
solid	1
worth	1
of	1
a	1
Forsyte	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
always	1
thus	1
be	1
a	1
‘little	1
thing’—	1
the	1
little	1
thing	1
was	1
bored.	1
Why	1
shouldn’t	1
she	1
amuse	1
herself?	1
Soames	1
was	1
rather	1
tiring;	1
and	1
as	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Bosinney	1
—	1
only	1
that	1
buffoon	1
George	1
would	1
have	1
called	1
him	1
the	1
Buccaneer	1
—	1
she	1
maintained	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
chic.	1
This	1
dictum	1
—	1
that	1
Bosinney	1
was	1
chic	1
—	1
caused	1
quit	1
a	1
sensation.	1
It	1
failed	1
to	1
convince.	1
That	1
he	1
was	1
‘good-looking	1
in	1
a	1
way’	1
they	1
were	1
prepared	1
to	1
admit,	1
but	1
that	1
anyone	1
could	1
call	1
a	1
man	1
with	1
his	1
pronounced	1
cheekbones,	1
curious	1
eyes,	1
and	1
soft	1
felt	1
hats	1
chic	1
was	1
only	1
another	1
instance	1
of	1
Winifred’s	1
extravagant	1
way	1
of	1
running	1
after	1
something	1
new.	1
It	1
was	1
that	1
famous	1
summer	1
when	1
extravagance	1
was	1
fashionable,	1
when	1
the	1
very	1
earth	1
was	1
extravagant,	1
chestnut-trees	1
spread	1
with	1
blossom,	1
and	1
flowers	1
drenched	1
in	1
perfume,	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
before;	1
when	1
roses	1
blew	1
in	1
every	1
garden;	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
swarming	1
stars	1
the	1
nights	1
had	1
hardly	1
space;	1
when	1
every	1
day	1
and	1
all	1
day	1
long	1
the	1
sun,	1
in	1
full	1
armour,	1
swung	1
his	1
brazen	1
shield	1
above	1
the	1
Park,	1
and	1
people	1
did	1
strange	1
things,	1
lunching	1
and	1
dining	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
air.	1
Unprecedented	1
was	1
the	1
tale	1
of	1
cabs	1
and	1
carriages	1
that	1
streamed	1
across	1
the	1
bridges	1
of	1
the	1
shining	1
river,	1
bearing	1
the	1
upper-middle	1
class	1
in	1
thousands	1
to	1
the	1
green	1
glories	1
of	1
Bushey,	1
Richmond,	1
Kew,	1
and	1
Hampton	1
Court.	1
Almost	1
every	1
family	1
with	1
any	1
pretensions	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
carriage-class	1
paid	1
one	1
visit	1
that	1
year	1
to	1
the	1
horse-chestnuts	1
at	1
Bushey,	1
or	1
took	1
one	1
drive	1
amongst	1
the	1
Spanish	1
chestnuts	1
of	1
Richmond	1
Park.	1
Bowling	1
smoothly,	1
if	1
dustily,	1
along,	1
in	1
a	1
cloud	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
creation,	1
they	1
would	1
stare	1
fashionably	1
at	1
the	1
antlered	1
heads	1
which	1
the	1
great	1
slow	1
deer	1
raised	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
forest	1
of	1
bracken	1
that	1
promised	1
to	1
autumn	1
lovers	1
such	1
cover	1
as	1
was	1
never	1
seen	1
before.	1
And	1
now	1
and	1
again,	1
as	1
the	1
amorous	1
perfume	1
of	1
chestnut	1
flowers	1
and	1
of	1
fern	1
was	1
drifted	1
too	1
near,	1
one	1
would	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
other:	1
“My	1
dear!	1
What	1
a	1
peculiar	1
scent!”	1
And	1
the	1
lime-flowers	1
that	1
year	1
were	1
of	1
rare	1
prime,	1
near	1
honey-coloured.	1
At	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
London	1
squares	1
they	1
gave	1
out,	1
as	1
the	1
sun	1
went	1
down,	1
a	1
perfume	1
sweeter	1
than	1
the	1
honey	1
bees	1
had	1
taken	1
—	1
a	1
perfume	1
that	1
stirred	1
a	1
yearning	1
unnamable	1
in	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
Forsytes	1
and	1
their	1
peers,	1
taking	1
the	1
cool	1
after	1
dinner	1
in	1
the	1
precincts	1
of	1
those	1
gardens	1
to	1
which	1
they	1
alone	1
had	1
keys.	1
And	1
that	1
yearning	1
made	1
them	1
linger	1
amidst	1
the	1
dim	1
shapes	1
of	1
flower-beds	1
in	1
the	1
failing	1
daylight,	1
made	1
them	1
turn,	1
and	1
turn,	1
and	1
turn	1
again,	1
as	1
though	1
lovers	1
were	1
waiting	1
for	1
them	1
—	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
light	1
to	1
die	1
away	1
under	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
the	1
branches.	1
Some	1
vague	1
sympathy	1
evoked	1
by	1
the	1
scent	1
of	1
the	1
limes,	1
some	1
sisterly	1
desire	1
to	1
see	1
for	1
herself,	1
some	1
idea	1
of	1
demonstrating	1
the	1
soundness	1
of	1
her	1
dictum	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
‘nothing	1
in	1
it’;	1
or	1
merely	1
the	1
craving	1
to	1
drive	1
down	1
to	1
Richmond,	1
irresistible	1
that	1
summer,	1
moved	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
Darties	1
(of	1
little	1
Publius,	1
of	1
Imogen,	1
Maud,	1
and	1
Benedict)	1
to	1
write	1
the	1
following	1
note	1
to	1
her	1
sister-in-law:	1
‘DEAR	1
IRENE,	1
‘June	1

hear	1
that	1

thought	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
great	1
fun	1

DARTIE.	1
‘Montague	1
believes	1
the	1
dinner	1
at	1
the	1
Crown	1
and	1
Sceptre	1
to	1
be	1
quite	1
eatable.’	1
Montague	1
was	1
Dartie’s	1
second	1
and	1
better	1
known	1
name	1
—	1
his	1
first	1
being	1
Moses;	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
nothing	1
if	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
Her	1
plan	1
met	1
with	1
more	1
opposition	1
from	1
Providence	1
than	1
so	1
benevolent	1
a	1
scheme	1
deserved.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
young	1
Flippard	1
wrote:	1
‘DEAR	1
Mrs.	1
DARTIE,	1
‘Awfully	1
sorry.	1
Engaged	1
two	1
deep.	1
‘Yours,	1
‘AUGUSTUS	1
FLIPPARD.’	1
It	1
was	1
late	1
to	1
send	1
into	1
the	1
by-ways	1
and	1
hedges	1
to	1
remedy	1
this	1
misfortune.	1
With	1
the	1
promptitude	1
and	1
conduct	1
of	1
a	1
mother,	1
Winifred	1
fell	1
back	1
on	1
her	1
husband.	1
She	1
had,	1
indeed,	1
the	1
decided	1
but	1
tolerant	1
temperament	1
that	1
goes	1
with	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
of	1
profile,	1
fair	1
hair,	1
and	1
greenish	1
eyes.	1
She	1
was	1
seldom	1
or	1
never	1
at	1
a	1
loss;	1
or	1
if	1
at	1
a	1
loss,	1
was	1
always	1
able	1
to	1
convert	1
it	1
into	1
a	1
gain.	1
Dartie,	1
too,	1
was	1
in	1
good	1
feather.	1
Erotic	1
had	1
failed	1
to	1
win	1
the	1
Lancashire	1
Cup.	1
Indeed,	1
that	1
celebrated	1
animal,	1
owned	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
by	1
a	1
pillar	1
of	1
the	1
turf,	1
who	1
had	1
secretly	1
laid	1
many	1
thousands	1
against	1
him,	1
had	1
not	1
even	1
started.	1
The	1
forty-eight	1
hours	1
that	1
followed	1
his	1
scratching	1
were	1
among	1
the	1
darkest	1
in	1
Dartie’s	1
life.	1
Visions	1
of	1
James	1
haunted	1
him	1
day	1
and	1
night.	1
Black	1
thoughts	1
about	1
Soames	1
mingled	1
with	1
the	1
faintest	1
hopes.	1
On	1
the	1
Friday	1
night	1
he	1
got	1
drunk,	1
so	1
greatly	1
was	1
he	1
affected.	1
But	1
on	1
Saturday	1
morning	1
the	1
true	1
Stock	1
Exchange	1
instinct	1
triumphed	1
within	1
him.	1
Owing	1
some	1
hundreds,	1
which	1
by	1
no	1
possibility	1
could	1
he	1
pay,	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
town	1
and	1
put	1
them	1
all	1
on	1
Concertina	1
for	1
the	1
Saltown	1
Borough	1
Handicap.	1
As	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Major	1
Scrotton,	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
lunched	1
at	1
the	1
Iseeum:	1
“That	1
little	1
Jew	1
boy,	1
Nathans,	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
the	1
tip.	1
He	1
didn’t	1
care	1
a	1
cursh.	1
He	1
wash	1
in	1
—	1
a	1
mucker.	1
If	1
it	1
didn’t	1
come	1
up	1
—	1
well	1
then,	1
damme,	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
pay!”	1
A	1
bottle	1
of	1
Pol	1
Roger	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
cheek	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
a	1
new	1
contempt	1
for	1
James.	1
It	1
came	1
up.	1
Concertina	1
was	1
squeezed	1
home	1
by	1
her	1
neck	1
—	1
a	1
terrible	1
squeak!	1
But,	1
as	1
Dartie	1
said:	1
There	1
was	1
nothing	1
like	1
pluck!	1
He	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
averse	1
to	1
the	1
expedition	1
to	1
Richmond.	1
He	1
would	1
‘stand’	1
it	1
himself!	1
He	1
cherished	1
an	1
admiration	1
for	1
Irene,	1
and	1
wished	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
more	1
playful	1
terms	1
with	1
her.	1
At	1
half-past	1
five	1
the	1
Park	1
Lane	1
footman	1
came	1
round	1
to	1
say:	1
Mrs.	1
Forsyte	1
was	1
very	1
sorry,	1
but	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
horses	1
was	1
coughing!	1
Undaunted	1
by	1
this	1
further	1
blow,	1
Winifred	1
at	1
once	1
despatched	1
little	1
Publius	1
(now	1
aged	1
seven)	1
with	1
the	1
nursery	1
governess	1
to	1
Montpellier	1
Square.	1
They	1
would	1
go	1
down	1
in	1
hansoms	1
and	1
meet	1
at	1
the	1
Crown	1
and	1
Sceptre	1
at	1
7.45.	1
Dartie,	1
on	1
being	1
told,	1
was	1
pleased	1
enough.	1
It	1
was	1
better	1
than	1
going	1
down	1
with	1
your	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
horses!	1
He	1
had	1
no	1
objection	1
to	1
driving	1
down	1
with	1
Irene.	1
He	1
supposed	1
they	1
would	1
pick	1
up	1
the	1
others	1
at	1
Montpellier	1
Square,	1
and	1
swop	1
hansoms	1
there?	1
Informed	1
that	1
the	1
meet	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
Crown	1
and	1
Sceptre,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
drive	1
with	1
his	1
wife,	1
he	1
turned	1
sulky,	1
and	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
d	1
—-d	1
slow!	1
At	1
seven	1
o’clock	1
they	1
started,	1
Dartie	1
offering	1
to	1
bet	1
the	1
driver	1
half-a-crown	1
he	1
didn’t	1
do	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
three-quarters	1
of	1
an	1
hour.	1
Twice	1
only	1
did	1
husband	1
and	1
wife	1
exchange	1
remarks	1
on	1
the	1
way.	1
Dartie	1
said:	1
“It’ll	1
put	1
Master	1
Soames’s	1
nose	1
out	1
of	1
joint	1
to	1
hear	1
his	1
wife’s	1
been	1
drivin’	1
in	1
a	1
hansom	1
with	1
Master	1
Bosinney!”	1
Winifred	1
replied:	1
“Don’t	1
talk	1
such	1
nonsense,	1
Monty!”	1
“Nonsense!”	1
repeated	1
Dartie.	1
“You	1
don’t	1
know	1
women,	1
my	1
fine	1
lady!”	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
occasion	1
he	1
merely	1
asked:	1
“How	1
am	1
I	1
looking?	1
A	1
bit	1
puffy	1
about	1
the	1
gills?	1
That	1
fizz	1
old	1
George	1
is	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
is	1
a	1
windy	1
wine!”	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
lunching	1
with	1
George	1
Forsyte	1
at	1
the	1
Haversnake.	1
Bosinney	1
and	1
Irene	1
had	1
arrived	1
before	1
them.	1
They	1
were	1
standing	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
long	1
French	1
windows	1
overlooking	1
the	1
river.	1
Windows	1
that	1
summer	1
were	1
open	1
all	1
day	1
long,	1
and	1
all	1
night	1
too,	1
and	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
the	1
scents	1
of	1
flowers	1
and	1
trees	1
came	1
in,	1
the	1
hot	1
scent	1
of	1
parching	1
grass,	1
and	1
the	1
cool	1
scent	1
of	1
the	1
heavy	1
dews.	1
To	1
the	1
eye	1
of	1
the	1
observant	1
Dartie	1
his	1
two	1
guests	1
did	1
not	1
appear	1
to	1
be	1
making	1
much	1
running,	1
standing	1
there	1
close	1
together,	1
without	1
a	1
word.	1
Bosinney	1
was	1
a	1
hungry-looking	1
creature	1
—	1
not	1
much	1
go	1
about	1
him.	1
He	1
left	1
them	1
to	1
Winifred,	1
however,	1
and	1
busied	1
himself	1
to	1
order	1
the	1
dinner.	1
A	1
Forsyte	1
will	1
require	1
good,	1
if	1
not	1
delicate	1
feeding,	1
but	1
a	1
Dartie	1
will	1
tax	1
the	1
resources	1
of	1
a	1
Crown	1
and	1
Sceptre.	1
Living	1
as	1
he	1
does,	1
from	1
hand	1
to	1
mouth,	1
nothing	1
is	1
too	1
good	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
eat;	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
eat	1
it.	1
His	1
drink,	1
too,	1
will	1
need	1
to	1
be	1
carefully	1
provided;	1
there	1
is	1
much	1
drink	1
in	1
this	1
country	1
‘not	1
good	1
enough’	1
for	1
a	1
Dartie;	1
he	1
will	1
have	1
the	1
best.	1
Paying	1
for	1
things	1
vicariously,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
reason	1
why	1
he	1
should	1
stint	1
himself.	1
To	1
stint	1
yourself	1
is	1
the	1
mark	1
of	1
a	1
fool,	1
not	1
of	1
a	1
Dartie.	1
The	1
best	1
of	1
everything!	1
No	1
sounder	1
principle	1
on	1
which	1
a	1
man	1
can	1
base	1
his	1
life,	1
whose	1
father-in-law	1
has	1
a	1
very	1
considerable	1
income,	1
and	1
a	1
partiality	1
for	1
his	1
grandchildren.	1
With	1
his	1
not	1
unable	1
eye	1
Dartie	1
had	1
spotted	1
this	1
weakness	1
in	1
James	1
the	1
very	1
first	1
year	1
after	1
little	1
Publius’s	1
arrival	1
(an	1
error);	1
he	1
had	1
profited	1
by	1
his	1
perspicacity.	1
Four	1
little	1
Darties	1
were	1
now	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
perpetual	1
insurance.	1
The	1
feature	1
of	1
the	1
feast	1
was	1
unquestionably	1
the	1
red	1
mullet.	1
This	1
delectable	1
fish,	1
brought	1
from	1
a	1
considerable	1
distance	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
almost	1
perfect	1
preservation,	1
was	1
first	1
fried,	1
then	1
boned,	1
then	1
served	1
in	1
ice,	1
with	1
Madeira	1
punch	1
in	1
place	1
of	1
sauce,	1
according	1
to	1
a	1
recipe	1
known	1
to	1
a	1
few	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
Nothing	1
else	1
calls	1
for	1
remark	1
except	1
the	1
payment	1
of	1
the	1
bill	1
by	1
Dartie.	1
He	1
had	1
made	1
himself	1
extremely	1
agreeable	1
throughout	1
the	1
meal;	1
his	1
bold,	1
admiring	1
stare	1
seldom	1
abandoning	1
Irene’s	1
face	1
and	1
figure.	1
As	1
he	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
confess	1
to	1
himself,	1
he	1
got	1
no	1
change	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
—	1
she	1
was	1
cool	1
enough,	1
as	1
cool	1
as	1
her	1
shoulders	1
looked	1
under	1
their	1
veil	1
of	1
creamy	1
lace.	1
He	1
expected	1
to	1
have	1
caught	1
her	1
out	1
in	1
some	1
little	1
game	1
with	1
Bosinney;	1
but	1
not	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
it,	1
she	1
kept	1
up	1
her	1
end	1
remarkably	1
well.	1
As	1
for	1
that	1
architect	1
chap,	1
he	1
was	1
as	1
glum	1
as	1
a	1
bear	1
with	1
a	1
sore	1
head	1
—	1
Winifred	1
could	1
barely	1
get	1
a	1
word	1
out	1
of	1
him;	1
he	1
ate	1
nothing,	1
but	1
he	1
certainly	1
took	1
his	1
liquor,	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
kept	1
getting	1
whiter,	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
looked	1
queer.	1
It	1
was	1
all	1
very	1
amusing.	1
For	1
Dartie	1
himself	1
was	1
in	1
capital	1
form,	1
and	1
talked	1
freely,	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
poignancy,	1
being	1
no	1
fool.	1
He	1
told	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
stories	1
verging	1
on	1
the	1
improper,	1
a	1
concession	1
to	1
the	1
company,	1
for	1
his	1
stories	1
were	1
not	1
used	1
to	1
verging.	1
He	1
proposed	1
Irene’s	1
health	1
in	1
a	1
mock	1
speech.	1
Nobody	1
drank	1
it,	1
and	1
Winifred	1
said:	1
“Don’t	1
be	1
such	1
a	1
clown,	1
Monty!”	1
At	1
her	1
suggestion	1
they	1
went	1
after	1
dinner	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
terrace	1
overlooking	1
the	1
river.	1
“I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
common	1
people	1
making	1
love,”	1
she	1
said,	1
“it’s	1
such	1
fun!”	1
There	1
were	1
numbers	1
of	1
them	1
walking	1
in	1
the	1
cool,	1
after	1
the	1
day’s	1
heat,	1
and	1
the	1
air	1
was	1
alive	1
with	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
voices,	1
coarse	1
and	1
loud,	1
or	1
soft	1
as	1
though	1
murmuring	1
secrets.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
long	1
before	1
Winifred’s	1
better	1
sense	1
—	1
she	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
Forsyte	1
present	1
—	1
secured	1
them	1
an	1
empty	1
bench.	1
They	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
row.	1
A	1
heavy	1
tree	1
spread	1
a	1
thick	1
canopy	1
above	1
their	1
heads,	1
and	1
the	1
haze	1
darkened	1
slowly	1
over	1
the	1
river.	1
Dartie	1
sat	1
at	1
the	1
end,	1
next	1
to	1
him	1
Irene,	1
then	1
Bosinney,	1
then	1
Winifred.	1
There	1
was	1
hardly	1
room	1
for	1
four,	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
could	1
feel	1
Irene’s	1
arm	1
crushed	1
against	1
his	1
own;	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
withdraw	1
it	1
without	1
seeming	1
rude,	1
and	1
this	1
amused	1
him;	1
he	1
devised	1
every	1
now	1
and	1
again	1
a	1
movement	1
that	1
would	1
bring	1
her	1
closer	1
still.	1
He	1
thought:	1
‘That	1
Buccaneer	1
Johnny	1
shan’t	1
have	1
it	1
all	1
to	1
himself!	1
It’s	1
a	1
pretty	1
tight	1
fit,	1
certainly!’	1
From	1
far	1
down	1
below	1
on	1
the	1
dark	1
river	1
came	1
drifting	1
the	1
tinkle	1
of	1
a	1
mandoline,	1
and	1
voices	1
singing	1
the	1
old	1
round:	1
‘A	1
boat,	1
a	1
boat,	1
unto	1
the	1
ferry,	1
For	1
we’ll	1
go	1
over	1
and	1
be	1
merry;	1
And	1
laugh,	1
and	1
quaff,	1
and	1
drink	1
brown	1
sherry!’	1
And	1
suddenly	1
the	1
moon	1
appeared,	1
young	1
and	1
tender,	1
floating	1
up	1
on	1
her	1
back	1
from	1
behind	1
a	1
tree;	1
and	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
breathed,	1
the	1
air	1
was	1
cooler,	1
but	1
down	1
that	1
cooler	1
air	1
came	1
always	1
the	1
warm	1
odour	1
of	1
the	1
limes.	1
Over	1
his	1
cigar	1
Dartie	1
peered	1
round	1
at	1
Bosinney,	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
with	1
his	1
arms	1
crossed,	1
staring	1
straight	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
being	1
tortured.	1
And	1
Dartie	1
shot	1
a	1
glance	1
at	1
the	1
face	1
between,	1
so	1
veiled	1
by	1
the	1
overhanging	1
shadow	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
but	1
like	1
a	1
darker	1
piece	1
of	1
the	1
darkness	1
shaped	1
and	1
breathed	1
on;	1
soft,	1
mysterious,	1
enticing.	1
A	1
hush	1
had	1
fallen	1
on	1
the	1
noisy	1
terrace,	1
as	1
if	1
all	1
the	1
strollers	1
were	1
thinking	1
secrets	1
too	1
precious	1
to	1
be	1
spoken.	1
And	1
Dartie	1
thought:	1
‘Women!’	1
The	1
glow	1
died	1
above	1
the	1
river,	1
the	1
singing	1
ceased;	1
the	1
young	1
moon	1
hid	1
behind	1
a	1
tree,	1
and	1
all	1
was	1
dark.	1
He	1
pressed	1
himself	1
against	1
Irene.	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
alarmed	1
at	1
the	1
shuddering	1
that	1
ran	1
through	1
the	1
limbs	1
he	1
touched,	1
or	1
at	1
the	1
troubled,	1
scornful	1
look	1
of	1
her	1
eyes.	1
He	1
felt	1
her	1
trying	1
to	1
draw	1
herself	1
away,	1
and	1
smiled.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
confessed	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
had	1
drunk	1
quite	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
was	1
good	1
for	1
him.	1
With	1
thick	1
lips	1
parted	1
under	1
his	1
well-curled	1
moustaches,	1
and	1
his	1
bold	1
eyes	1
aslant	1
upon	1
her,	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
malicious	1
look	1
of	1
a	1
satyr.	1
Along	1
the	1
pathway	1
of	1
sky	1
between	1
the	1
hedges	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
tops	1
the	1
stars	1
clustered	1
forth;	1
like	1
mortals	1
beneath,	1
they	1
seemed	1
to	1
shift	1
and	1
swarm	1
and	1
whisper.	1
Then	1
on	1
the	1
terrace	1
the	1
buzz	1
broke	1
out	1
once	1
more,	1
and	1
Dartie	1
thought:	1
‘Ah!	1
he’s	1
a	1
poor,	1
hungry-looking	1
devil,	1
that	1
Bosinney!’	1
and	1
again	1
he	1
pressed	1
himself	1
against	1
Irene.	1
The	1
movement	1
deserved	1
a	1
better	1
success.	1
She	1
rose,	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
followed	1
her.	1
The	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
ever	1
determined	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
made	1
of.	1
Along	1
the	1
terrace	1
he	1
kept	1
close	1
at	1
her	1
elbow.	1
He	1
had	1
within	1
him	1
much	1
good	1
wine.	1
There	1
was	1
the	1
long	1
drive	1
home,	1
the	1
long	1
drive	1
and	1
the	1
warm	1
dark	1
and	1
the	1
pleasant	1
closeness	1
of	1
the	1
hansom	1
cab	1
—	1
with	1
its	1
insulation	1
from	1
the	1
world	1
devised	1
by	1
some	1
great	1
and	1
good	1
man.	1
That	1
hungry	1
architect	1
chap	1
might	1
drive	1
with	1
his	1
wife	1
—	1
he	1
wished	1
him	1
joy	1
of	1
her!	1
And,	1
conscious	1
that	1
his	1
voice	1
was	1
not	1
too	1
steady,	1
he	1
was	1
careful	1
not	1
to	1
speak;	1
but	1
a	1
smile	1
had	1
become	1
fixed	1
on	1
his	1
thick	1
lips.	1
They	1
strolled	1
along	1
toward	1
the	1
cabs	1
awaiting	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
farther	1
end.	1
His	1
plan	1
had	1
the	1
merit	1
of	1
all	1
great	1
plans,	1
an	1
almost	1
brutal	1
simplicity	1
he	1
would	1
merely	1
keep	1
at	1
her	1
elbow	1
till	1
she	1
got	1
in,	1
and	1
get	1
in	1
quickly	1
after	1
her.	1
But	1
when	1
Irene	1
reached	1
the	1
cab	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
get	1
in;	1
she	1
slipped,	1
instead,	1
to	1
the	1
horse’s	1
head.	1
Dartie	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
sufficiently	1
master	1
of	1
his	1
legs	1
to	1
follow.	1
She	1
stood	1
stroking	1
the	1
horse’s	1
nose,	1
and,	1
to	1
his	1
annoyance,	1
Bosinney	1
was	1
at	1
her	1
side	1
first.	1
She	1
turned	1
and	1
spoke	1
to	1
him	1
rapidly,	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice;	1
the	1
words	1
‘That	1
man’	1
reached	1
Dartie.	1
He	1
stood	1
stubbornly	1
by	1
the	1
cab	1
step,	1
waiting	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
come	1
back.	1
He	1
knew	1
a	1
trick	1
worth	1
two	1
of	1
that!	1
Here,	1
in	1
the	1
lamp-light,	1
his	1
figure	1
(no	1
more	1
than	1
medium	1
height),	1
well	1
squared	1
in	1
its	1
white	1
evening	1
waistcoat,	1
his	1
light	1
overcoat	1
flung	1
over	1
his	1
arm,	1
a	1
pink	1
flower	1
in	1
his	1
button-hole,	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
dark	1
face	1
that	1
look	1
of	1
confident,	1
good-humoured	1
insolence,	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
his	1
best	1
—	1
a	1
thorough	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
Winifred	1
was	1
already	1
in	1
her	1
cab.	1
Dartie	1
reflected	1
that	1
Bosinney	1
would	1
have	1
a	1
poorish	1
time	1
in	1
that	1
cab	1
if	1
he	1
didn’t	1
look	1
sharp!	1
Suddenly	1
he	1
received	1
a	1
push	1
which	1
nearly	1
overturned	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
road.	1
Bosinney’s	1
voice	1
hissed	1
in	1
his	1
ear:	1
“I	1
am	1
taking	1
Irene	1
back;	1
do	1
you	1
understand?”	1
He	1
saw	1
a	1
face	1
white	1
with	1
passion,	1
and	1
eyes	1
that	1
glared	1
at	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
wild	1
cat’s.	1
“Eh?”	1
he	1
stammered.	1
“What?	1
Not	1
a	1
bit.	1
You	1
take	1
my	1
wife!”	1
“Get	1
away!”	1
hissed	1
Bosinney	1
—“or	1
I’ll	1
throw	1
you	1
into	1
the	1
road!”	1
Dartie	1
recoiled;	1
he	1
saw	1
as	1
plainly	1
as	1
possible	1
that	1
the	1
fellow	1
meant	1
it.	1
In	1
the	1
space	1
he	1
made	1
Irene	1
had	1
slipped	1
by,	1
her	1
dress	1
brushed	1
his	1
legs.	1
Bosinney	1
stepped	1
in	1
after	1
her.	1
“Go	1
on!”	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
Buccaneer	1
cry.	1
The	1
cabman	1
flicked	1
his	1
horse.	1
It	1
sprang	1
forward.	1
Dartie	1
stood	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
dumbfounded;	1
then,	1
dashing	1
at	1
the	1
cab	1
where	1
his	1
wife	1
sat,	1
he	1
scrambled	1
in.	1
“Drive	1
on!”	1
he	1
shouted	1
to	1
the	1
driver,	1
“and	1
don’t	1
you	1
lose	1
sight	1
of	1
that	1
fellow	1
in	1
front!”	1
Seated	1
by	1
his	1
wife’s	1
side,	1
he	1
burst	1
into	1
imprecations.	1
Calming	1
himself	1
at	1
last	1
with	1
a	1
supreme	1
effort,	1
he	1
added:	1
“A	1
pretty	1
mess	1
you’ve	1
made	1
of	1
it,	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
Buccaneer	1
drive	1
home	1
with	1
her;	1
why	1
on	1
earth	1
couldn’t	1
you	1
keep	1
hold	1
of	1
him?	1
He’s	1
mad	1
with	1
love;	1
any	1
fool	1
can	1
see	1
that!”	1
He	1
drowned	1
Winifred’s	1
rejoinder	1
with	1
fresh	1
calls	1
to	1
the	1
Almighty;	1
nor	1
was	1
it	1
until	1
they	1
reached	1
Barnes	1
that	1
he	1
ceased	1
a	1
Jeremiad,	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
abused	1
her,	1
her	1
father,	1
her	1
brother,	1
Irene,	1
Bosinney,	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Forsyte,	1
his	1
own	1
children,	1
and	1
cursed	1
the	1
day	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
married.	1
Winifred,	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
strong	1
character,	1
let	1
him	1
have	1
his	1
say,	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
lapsed	1
into	1
sulky	1
silence.	1
His	1
angry	1
eyes	1
never	1
deserted	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
that	1
cab,	1
which,	1
like	1
a	1
lost	1
chance,	1
haunted	1
the	1
darkness	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him.	1
Fortunately	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
hear	1
Bosinney’s	1
passionate	1
pleading	1
—	1
that	1
pleading	1
which	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
world’s	1
conduct	1
had	1
let	1
loose	1
like	1
a	1
flood;	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
Irene	1
shivering,	1
as	1
though	1
some	1
garment	1
had	1
been	1
torn	1
from	1
her,	1
nor	1
her	1
eyes,	1
black	1
and	1
mournful,	1
like	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
a	1
beaten	1
child.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
hear	1
Bosinney	1
entreating,	2
always	1
entreating;	1
could	1
not	1
hear	1
her	1
sudden,	1
soft	1
weeping,	1
nor	1
see	1
that	1
poor,	1
hungry-looking	1
devil,	1
awed	1
and	1
trembling,	1
humbly	1
touching	1
her	1
hand.	1
In	1
Montpellier	1
Square	1
their	1
cabman,	1
following	1
his	1
instructions	1
to	1
the	1
letter,	1
faithfully	1
drew	1
up	1
behind	1
the	1
cab	1
in	1
front.	1
The	1
Darties	1
saw	1
Bosinney	1
spring	1
out,	1
and	1
Irene	1
follow,	1
and	1
hasten	1
up	1
the	1
steps	1
with	1
bent	1
head.	1
She	1
evidently	1
had	1
her	1
key	1
in	1
her	1
hand,	1
for	1
she	1
disappeared	1
at	1
once.	1
It	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
tell	1
whether	1
she	1
had	1
turned	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
Bosinney.	1
The	1
latter	1
came	1
walking	1
past	1
their	1
cab;	1
both	1
husband	1
and	1
wife	1
had	1
an	1
admirable	1
view	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
a	1
street	1
lamp.	1
It	1
was	1
working	1
with	1
violent	1
emotion.	1
“Good-night,	1
Mr.	1
Bosinney!”	1
called	1
Winifred.	1
Bosinney	1
started,	1
clawed	1
off	1
his	1
hat,	1
and	1
hurried	1
on.	1
He	1
had	1
obviously	1
forgotten	1
their	1
existence.	1
“There!”	1
said	1
Dartie,	1
“did	1
you	1
see	1
the	1
beast’s	1
face?	1
What	1
did	1
I	1
say?	1
Fine	1
games!”	1
He	1
improved	1
the	1
occasion.	1
There	1
had	1
so	1
clearly	1
been	1
a	1
crisis	1
in	1
the	1
cab	1
that	1
Winifred	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
defend	1
her	1
theory.	1
She	1
said:	1
“I	1
shall	1
say	1
nothing	1
about	1
it.	1
I	1
don’t	1
see	1
any	1
use	1
in	1
making	1
a	1
fuss!”	1
With	1
that	1
view	1
Dartie	1
at	1
once	1
concurred;	1
looking	1
upon	1
James	1
as	1
a	1
private	1
preserve,	1
he	1
disapproved	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
disturbed	1
by	1
the	1
troubles	1
of	1
others.	1
“Quite	1
right,”	1
he	1
said;	1
“let	1
Soames	1
look	1
after	1
himself.	1
He’s	1
jolly	1
well	1
able	1
to!”	1
Thus	1
speaking,	1
the	1
Darties	1
entered	1
their	1
habitat	1
in	1
Green	1
Street,	1
the	1
rent	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
paid	1
by	1
James,	1
and	1
sought	1
a	1
well-earned	1
rest.	1
The	1
hour	1
was	1
midnight,	1
and	1
no	1
Forsytes	1
remained	1
abroad	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
to	1
spy	1
out	1
Bosinney’s	1
wanderings;	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
return	1
and	1
stand	1
against	1
the	1
rails	1
of	1
the	1
Square	1
garden,	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
glow	1
of	1
the	1
street	1
lamp;	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
stand	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
trees,	1
watching	1
the	1
house	1
where	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
was	1
hidden	1
she	1
whom	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
see	1
for	1
a	1
single	1
minute	1
—	1
she	1
who	1
was	1
now	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
breath	1
of	1
the	1
lime-trees,	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
light	1
and	1
the	1
darkness,	1
the	1
very	1
beating	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
heart.	1
Chapter	1
19	1
Diagnosis	1
of	1
a	1
Forsyte	1
It	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
a	1
Forsyte	1
to	1
be	1
ignorant	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
Forsyte;	1
but	1
young	1
Jolyon	1
was	1
well	1
aware	1
of	1
being	1
one.	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
known	1
it	1
till	1
after	1
the	1
decisive	1
step	1
which	1
had	1
made	1
him	1
an	1
outcast;	1
since	1
then	1
the	1
knowledge	1
had	1
been	1
with	1
him	1
continually.	1
He	1
felt	1
it	1
throughout	1
his	1
alliance,	1
throughout	1
all	1
his	1
dealings	1
with	1
his	1
second	1
wife,	1
who	1
was	1
emphatically	1
not	1
a	1
Forsyte.	1
He	1
knew	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
possessed	1
in	1
great	1
measure	1
the	1
eye	1
for	1
what	1
he	1
wanted,	1
the	1
tenacity	1
to	1
hold	1
on	1
to	1
it,	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
folly	1
of	1
wasting	1
that	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
so	1
big	1
a	1
price	1
—	1
in	1
other	1
words,	1
the	1
‘sense	1
of	1
property’	1
he	1
could	1
never	1
have	1
retained	1
her	1
(perhaps	1
never	1
would	1
have	1
desired	1
to	1
retain	1
her)	1
with	1
him	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
financial	1
troubles,	1
slights,	1
and	1
misconstructions	1
of	1
those	1
fifteen	1
years;	1
never	1
have	1
induced	1
her	1
to	1
marry	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
his	1
first	1
wife;	1
never	1
have	1
lived	1
it	1
all	1
through,	1
and	1
come	1
up,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
thin,	1
but	1
smiling.	1
He	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
men	1
who,	1
seated	1
cross-legged	1
like	1
miniature	1
Chinese	1
idols	1
in	1
the	1
cages	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
hearts,	1
are	1
ever	1
smiling	1
at	1
themselves	1
a	1
doubting	1
smile.	1
Not	1
that	1
this	1
smile,	1
so	1
intimate	1
and	1
eternal,	1
interfered	1
with	1
his	1
actions,	1
which,	1
like	1
his	1
chin	1
and	1
his	1
temperament,	1
were	1
quite	1
a	1
peculiar	1
blend	1
of	1
softness	1
and	1
determination.	1
He	1
was	1
conscious,	1
too,	1
of	1
being	1
a	1
Forsyte	1
in	1
his	1
work,	1
that	1
painting	1
of	1
water-colours	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
devoted	1
so	1
much	1
energy,	1
always	1
with	1
an	1
eye	1
on	1
himself,	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
take	1
so	1
unpractical	1
a	1
pursuit	1
quite	1
seriously,	1
and	1
always	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
queer	1
uneasiness	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
make	1
more	1
money	1
at	1
it.	1
It	1
was,	1
then,	1
this	1
consciousness	1
of	1
what	1
it	1
meant	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
Forsyte,	1
that	1
made	1
him	1
receive	1
the	1
following	1
letter	1
from	1
old	1
Jolyon,	1
with	1
a	1
mixture	1
of	1
sympathy	1
and	1
disgust:	1
‘SHELDRAKE	1
HOUSE,	1
‘BROADSTAIRS,	1
‘July	1
1.	1
‘MY	1
DEAR	1
JO,’	1
(The	1
Dad’s	1
handwriting	1
had	1
altered	1
very	1
little	1
in	1
the	1
thirty	1
odd	1
years	1
that	1
he	1
remembered	1
it.)	1
‘We	1
have	1
been	1
here	1
now	1
a	1
fortnight,	1
and	1
have	1
had	1
good	1
weather	1
on	1
the	1
whole.	1
The	1
air	1
is	1
bracing,	1
but	1
my	1
liver	1
is	1
out	1
of	1
order,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
glad	1
enough	1
to	1
get	1
back	1
to	1
town.	1
I	1
cannot	1
say	1
much	1
for	1
June,	1
her	1
health	1
and	1
spirits	1
are	1
very	1
indifferent,	1
and	1
I	1
don’t	1
see	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
come	1
of	1
it.	1
She	1
says	1
nothing,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
clear	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
harping	1
on	1
this	1
engagement,	1
which	1
is	1
an	1
engagement	1
and	1
no	1
engagement,	1
and	1
—	1
goodness	1
knows	1
what.	1
I	1
have	1
grave	1
doubts	1
whether	1
she	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
London	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
state	1
of	1
affairs,	1
but	1
she	1
is	1
so	1
self-willed	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
take	1
it	1
into	1
her	1
head	1
to	1
come	1
up	1
at	1
any	1
moment.	1
The	1
fact	1
is	1
someone	1
ought	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
Bosinney	1
and	1
ascertain	1
what	1
he	1
means.	1
I’m	1
afraid	1
of	1
this	1
myself,	1
for	1
I	1
should	1
certainly	1
rap	1
him	1
over	1
the	1
knuckles,	1
but	1
I	1
thought	1
that	1
you,	1
knowing	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
Club,	1
might	1
put	1
in	1
a	1
word,	1
and	1
get	1
to	1
ascertain	1
what	1
the	1
fellow	1
is	1
about.	1
You	1
will	1
of	1
course	1
in	1
no	1
way	1
commit	1
June.	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
hear	1
from	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
whether	1
you	1
have	1
succeeded	1
in	1
gaining	1
any	1
information.	1
The	1
situation	1
is	1
very	1
distressing	1
to	1
me,	1
I	1
worry	1
about	1
it	1
at	1
night.	1
With	1
my	1
love	1
to	1
Jolly	1
and	1
Holly.	1
‘I	1
am,	1
‘Your	1
affect.	1
father,	1
‘JOLYON	1
FORSYTE.’	1
Young	1
Jolyon	1
pondered	1
this	1
letter	1
so	1
long	1
and	1
seriously	1
that	1
his	1
wife	1
noticed	1
his	1
preoccupation,	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
matter.	1
He	1
replied:	1
“Nothing.”	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
fixed	1
principle	1
with	1
him	1
never	1
to	1
allude	1
to	1
June.	1
She	1
might	1
take	1
alarm,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
she	1
might	1
think;	1
he	1
hastened,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
banish	1
from	1
his	1
manner	1
all	1
traces	1
of	1
absorption,	1
but	1
in	1
this	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
as	1
successful	1
as	1
his	1
father	1
would	1
have	1
been,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
inherited	1
all	1
old	1
Jolyon’s	1
transparency	1
in	1
matters	1
of	1
domestic	1
finesse;	1
and	1
young	1
Mrs.	1
Jolyon,	1
busying	1
herself	1
over	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
went	1
about	1
with	1
tightened	1
lips,	1
stealing	1
at	1
him	1
unfathomable	1
looks.	1
He	1
started	1
for	1
the	1
Club	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon	1
with	1
the	1
letter	1
in	1
his	1
pocket,	1
and	1
without	1
having	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind.	1
To	1
sound	1
a	1
man	1
as	1
to	1
‘his	1
intentions’	1
was	1
peculiarly	1
unpleasant	1
to	1
him;	1
nor	1
did	1
his	1
own	1
anomalous	1
position	1
diminish	1
this	1
unpleasantness.	1
It	1
was	1
so	1
like	1
his	1
family,	1
so	1
like	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
they	1
knew	1
and	1
mixed	1
with,	1
to	1
enforce	1
what	1
they	1
called	1
their	1
rights	1
over	1
a	1
man,	1
to	1
bring	1
him	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
mark;	1
so	1
like	1
them	1
to	1
carry	1
their	1
business	1
principles	1
into	1
their	1
private	1
relations.	1
And	1
how	1
that	1
phrase	1
in	1
the	1
letter	1
—‘You	1
will,	1
of	1
course,	1
in	1
no	1
way	1
commit	1
June’—	1
gave	1
the	1
whole	1
thing	1
away.	1
Yet	1
the	1
letter,	1
with	1
the	1
personal	1
grievance,	1
the	1
concern	1
for	1
June,	1
the	1
‘rap	1
over	1
the	1
knuckles,’	1
was	1
all	1
so	1
natural.	1
No	1
wonder	1
his	1
father	1
wanted	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
Bosinney	1
meant,	1
no	1
wonder	1
he	1
was	1
angry.	1
It	1
was	1
difficult	1
to	1
refuse!	1
But	1
why	1
give	1
the	1
thing	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
do?	1
That	1
was	1
surely	1
quite	1
unbecoming;	1
but	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
a	1
Forsyte	1
got	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
after,	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
too	1
particular	1
about	1
the	1
means,	1
provided	1
appearances	1
were	1
saved.	1
How	1
should	1
he	1
set	1
about	1
it,	1
or	1
how	1
refuse?	1
Both	1
seemed	1
impossible.	1
So,	1
young	1
Jolyon!	1
He	1
arrived	1
at	1
the	1
Club	1
at	1
three	1
o’clock,	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
person	1
he	1
saw	1
was	1
Bosinney	1
himself,	1
seated	1
in	1
a	1
corner,	1
staring	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window.	1
Young	1
Jolyon	1
sat	1
down	1
not	1
far	1
off,	1
and	1
began	1
nervously	1
to	1
reconsider	1
his	1
position.	1
He	1
looked	1
covertly	1
at	1
Bosinney	1
sitting	1
there	1
unconscious.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
him	1
very	1
well,	1
and	1
studied	1
him	1
attentively	1
for	1
perhaps	1
the	1
first	1
time;	1
an	1
unusual	1
looking	1
man,	1
unlike	1
in	1
dress,	1
face,	1
and	1
manner	1
to	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
Club	1
—	1
young	1
Jolyon	1
himself,	1
however	1
different	1
he	1
had	1
become	1
in	1
mood	1
and	1
temper,	1
had	1
always	1
retained	1
the	1
neat	1
reticence	1
of	1
Forsyte	1
appearance.	1
He	1
alone	1
among	1
Forsytes	1
was	1
ignorant	1
of	1
Bosinney’s	1
nickname.	1
The	1
man	1
was	1
unusual,	1
not	1
eccentric,	1
but	1
unusual;	1
he	1
looked	1
worn,	1
too,	1
haggard,	1
hollow	1
in	1
the	1
cheeks	1
beneath	1
those	1
broad,	1
high	1
cheekbones,	1
though	1
without	1
any	1
appearance	1
of	1
ill-health,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
strongly	1
built,	1
with	1
curly	1
hair	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
show	1
all	1
the	1
vitality	1
of	1
a	1
fine	1
constitution.	1
Something	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
attitude	1
touched	1
young	1
Jolyon.	1
He	1
knew	1
what	1
suffering	1
was	1
like,	1
and	1
this	1
man	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
suffering.	1
He	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
touched	1
his	1
arm.	1
Bosinney	1
started,	1
but	1
exhibited	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
embarrassment	1
on	1
seeing	1
who	1
it	1
was.	1
Young	1
Jolyon	1
sat	1
down.	1
“I	1
haven’t	1
seen	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time,”	1
he	1
said.	1
“How	1
are	1
you	1
getting	1
on	1
with	1
my	1
cousin’s	1
house?”	1
“It’ll	1
be	1
finished	1
in	1
about	1
a	1
week.”	1
“I	1
congratulate	1
you!”	1
“Thanks	1
—	1
I	1
don’t	1
know	1
that	1
it’s	1
much	1
of	1
a	1
subject	1
for	1
congratulation.”	1
“No?”	1
queried	1
young	1
Jolyon;	1
“I	1
should	1
have	1
thought	1
you’d	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
long	1
job	1
like	1
that	1
off	1
your	1
hands;	1
but	1
I	1
suppose	1
you	1
feel	1
it	1
much	1
as	1
I	1
do	1
when	1
I	1
part	1
with	1
a	1
picture	1
—	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
child?”	1
He	1
looked	1
kindly	1
at	1
Bosinney.	1
“Yes,”	1
said	1
the	1
latter	1
more	1
cordially,	1
“it	1
goes	1
out	1
from	1
you	1
and	1
there’s	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
it.	1
I	1
didn’t	1
know	1
you	1
painted.”	1
“Only	1
water-colours;	1
I	1
can’t	1
say	1
I	1
believe	1
in	1
my	1
work.”	1
“Don’t	1
believe	1
in	1
it?	1
There	1
—	1
how	1
can	1
you	1
do	1
it?	1
Work’s	1
no	1
use	1
unless	1
you	1
believe	1
in	1
it!”	1
“Good,”	1
said	1
young	1
Jolyon;	1
“it’s	1
exactly	1
what	1
I’ve	1
always	1
said.	1
By-the-bye,	1
have	1
you	1
noticed	1
that	1
whenever	1
one	1
says	1
‘Good,’	1
one	1
always	1
adds	1
‘it’s	1
exactly	1
what	1
I’ve	1
always	1
said’!	1
But	1
if	1
you	1
ask	1
me	1
how	1
I	1
do	1
it,	1
I	1
answer,	1
because	1
I’m	1
a	1
Forsyte.”	1
“A	1
Forsyte!	1
I	1
never	1
thought	1
of	1
you	1
as	1
one!”	1
“A	1
Forsyte,”	1
replied	1
young	1
Jolyon,	1
“is	1
not	1
an	1
uncommon	1
animal.	1
There	1
are	1
hundreds	1
among	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
this	1
Club.	1
Hundreds	1
out	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
streets;	1
you	1
meet	1
them	1
wherever	1
you	1
go!”	1
“And	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
tell	1
them,	1
may	1
I	1
ask?”	1
said	1
Bosinney.	1
“By	1
their	1
sense	1
of	1
property.	1
A	1
Forsyte	1
takes	1
a	1
practical	1
—	1
one	1
might	1
say	1
a	1
commonsense	1
—	1
view	1
of	1
things,	1
and	1
a	1
practical	1
view	1
of	1
things	1
is	1
based	1
fundamentally	1
on	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
property.	1
A	1
Forsyte,	1
you	1
will	1
notice,	1
never	1
gives	1
himself	1
away.”	1
“Joking?”	1
Young	1
Jolyon’s	1
eye	1
twinkled.	1
“Not	1
much.	1
As	1
a	1
Forsyte	1
myself,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
business	1
to	1
talk.	1
But	1
I’m	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
thoroughbred	1
mongrel;	1
now,	1
there’s	1
no	1
mistaking	1
you:	1
You’re	1
as	1
different	1
from	1
me	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
from	1
my	1
Uncle	1
James,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
perfect	1
specimen	1
of	1
a	1
Forsyte.	1
His	1
sense	1
of	1
property	1
is	1
extreme,	1
while	1
you	1
have	1
practically	1
none.	1
Without	1
me	1
in	1
between,	1
you	1
would	1
seem	1
like	1
a	1
different	1
species.	1
I’m	1
the	1
missing	1
link.	1
We	1
are,	1
of	1
course,	1
all	1
of	1
us	1
the	1
slaves	1
of	1
property,	1
and	1
I	1
admit	1
that	1
it’s	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
degree,	1
but	1
what	1
I	1
call	1
a	1
‘Forsyte’	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
decidedly	1
more	1
than	1
less	1
a	1
slave	1
of	1
property.	1
He	1
knows	1
a	1
good	1
thing,	1
he	1
knows	1
a	1
safe	1
thing,	1
and	1
his	1
grip	1
on	1
property	1
—	1
it	1
doesn’t	1
matter	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
wives,	1
houses,	1
money,	1
or	1
reputation	1
—	1
is	1
his	1
hall-mark.”	1
“Ah!”	1
murmured	1
Bosinney.	1
“You	1
should	1
patent	1
the	1
word.”	1
“I	1
should	1
like,”	1
said	1
young	1
Jolyon,	1
“to	1
lecture	1
on	1
it:	1
“Properties	1
and	1
quality	1
of	1
a	1
Forsyte:	1
This	1
little	1
animal,	1
disturbed	1
by	1
the	1
ridicule	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
sort,	1
is	1
unaffected	1
in	1
his	1
motions	1
by	1
the	1
laughter	1
of	1
strange	1
creatures	1
(you	1
or	1
I).	1
Hereditarily	1
disposed	1
to	1
myopia,	1
he	1
recognises	1
only	1
the	1
persons	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
species,	1
amongst	1
which	1
he	1
passes	1
an	1
existence	1
of	1
competitive	1
tranquillity.”	1
“You	1
talk	1
of	1
them,”	1
said	1
Bosinney,	1
“as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
half	1
England.”	1
“They	1
are,”	1
repeated	1
young	1
Jolyon,	1
“half	1
England,	1
and	1
the	1
better	1
half,	1
too,	1
the	1
safe	1
half,	1
the	1
three	1
per	1
cent.	1
half,	1
the	1
half	1
that	1
counts.	1
It’s	1
their	1
wealth	1
and	1
security	1
that	1
makes	1
everything	1
possible;	1
makes	1
your	1
art	1
possible,	1
makes	1
literature,	1
science,	1
even	1
religion,	1
possible.	1
Without	1
Forsytes,	1
who	1
believe	1
in	1
none	1
of	1
these	1
things,	1
and	1
habitats	1
but	1
turn	1
them	1
all	1
to	1
use,	1
where	1
should	1
we	1
be?	1
My	1
dear	1
sir,	1
the	1
Forsytes	1
are	1
the	1
middlemen,	1
the	1
commercials,	1
the	1
pillars	1
of	1
society,	1
the	1
cornerstones	1
of	1
convention;	1
everything	1
that	1
is	1
admirable!”	1
“I	1
don’t	1
know	1
whether	1
I	1
catch	1
your	1
drift,”	1
said	1
Bosinney,	1
“but	1
I	1
fancy	1
there	1
are	1
plenty	1
of	1
Forsytes,	1
as	1
you	1
call	1
them,	1
in	1
my	1
profession.”	1
“Certainly,”	1
replied	1
young	1
Jolyon.	1
“The	1
great	1
majority	1
of	1
architects,	1
painters,	1
or	1
writers	1
have	1
no	1
principles,	1
like	1
any	1
other	1
Forsytes.	1
Art,	1
literature,	1
religion,	1
survive	1
by	1
virtue	1
of	1
the	1
few	1
cranks	1
who	1
really	1
believe	1
in	1
such	1
things,	1
and	1
the	1
many	1
Forsytes	1
who	1
make	1
a	1
commercial	1
use	1
of	1
them.	1
At	1
a	1
low	1
estimate,	1
three-fourths	1
of	1
our	1
Royal	1
Academicians	1
are	1
Forsytes,	1
seven-eighths	1
of	1
our	1
novelists,	1
a	1
large	1
proportion	1
of	1
the	1
press.	1
Of	1
science	1
I	1
can’t	1
speak;	1
they	1
are	1
magnificently	1
represented	1
in	1
religion;	1
in	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Commons	1
perhaps	1
more	1
numerous	1
than	1
anywhere;	1
the	1
aristocracy	1
speaks	1
for	1
itself.	1
But	1
I’m	1
not	1
laughing.	1
It	1
is	1
dangerous	1
to	1
go	1
against	1
the	1
majority	1
and	1
what	1
a	1
majority!”	1
He	1
fixed	1
his	1
eyes	1
on	1
Bosinney:	1
“It’s	1
dangerous	1
to	1
let	1
anything	1
carry	1
you	1
away	1
—	1
a	1
house,	1
a	1
picture,	1
a	1
—	1
woman!”	1
They	1
looked	1
at	1
each	1
other.	1
—	1
And,	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
that	1
which	1
no	1
Forsyte	1
did	1
—	1
given	1
himself	1
away,	1
young	1
Jolyon	1
drew	1
into	1
his	1
shell.	1
Bosinney	1
broke	1
the	1
silence.	1
“Why	1
do	1
you	1
take	1
your	1
own	1
people	1
as	1
the	1
type?”	1
said	1
he.	1
“My	1
people,”	1
replied	1
young	1
Jolyon,	1
“are	1
not	1
very	1
extreme,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
their	1
own	1
private	1
peculiarities,	1
like	1
every	1
other	1
family,	1
but	1
they	1
possess	1
in	1
a	1
remarkable	1
degree	1
those	1
two	1
qualities	1
which	1
are	1
the	1
real	1
tests	1
of	1
a	1
Forsyte	1
—	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
never	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
give	1
yourself	1
up	1
to	1
anything	1
soul	1
and	1
body,	1
and	1
the	1
‘sense	1
of	1
property’.”	1
Bosinney	1
smiled:	1
“How	1
about	1
the	1
big	1
one,	1
for	1
instance?”	1
“Do	1
you	1
mean	1
Swithin?”	1
asked	1
young	1
Jolyon.	1
“Ah!	1
in	1
Swithin	1
there’s	1
something	1
primeval	1
still.	1
The	1
town	1
and	1
middle-class	1
life	1
haven’t	1
digested	1
him	1
yet.	1
All	1
the	1
old	1
centuries	1
of	1
farm	1
work	1
and	1
brute	1
force	1
have	1
settled	1
in	1
him,	1
and	1
there	1
they’ve	1
stuck,	1
for	1
all	1
he’s	1
so	1
distinguished.”	1
Bosinney	1
seemed	1
to	1
ponder.	1
“Well,	1
you’ve	1
hit	1
your	1
cousin	1
Soames	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
life,”	1
he	1
said	1
suddenly.	1
“He’ll	1
never	1
blow	1
his	1
brains	1
out.”	1
Young	1
Jolyon	1
shot	1
at	1
him	1
a	1
penetrating	1
glance.	1
“No,”	1
he	1
said;	1
“he	1
won’t.	1
That’s	1
why	1
he’s	1
to	1
be	1
reckoned	1
with.	1
Look	1
out	1
for	1
their	1
grip!	1
It’s	1
easy	1
to	1
laugh,	1
but	1
don’t	1
mistake	1
me.	1
It	1
doesn’t	1
do	1
to	1
despise	1
a	1
Forsyte;	1
it	1
doesn’t	1
do	1
to	1
disregard	1
them!”	1
“Yet	1
you’ve	1
done	1
it	1
yourself!”	1
Young	1
Jolyon	1
acknowledged	1
the	1
hit	1
by	1
losing	1
his	1
smile.	1
“You	1
forget,”	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
queer	1
pride,	1
“I	1
can	1
hold	1
on,	1
too	1
—	1
I’m	1
a	1
Forsyte	1
myself.	1
We’re	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
great	1
forces.	1
The	1
man	1
who	1
leaves	1
the	1
shelter	1
of	1
the	1
wall	1
—	1
well	1
—	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
mean.	1
I	1
don’t,”	1
he	1
ended	1
very	1
low,	1
as	1
though	1
uttering	1
a	1
threat,	1
“recommend	1
every	1
man	1
to-go-my-way.	1
It	1
depends.”	1
The	1
colour	1
rushed	1
into	1
Bosinney’s	1
face,	1
but	1
soon	1
receded,	1
leaving	1
it	1
sallow-brown	1
as	1
before.	1
He	1
gave	1
a	1
short	1
laugh,	1
that	1
left	1
his	1
lips	1
fixed	1
in	1
a	1
queer,	1
fierce	1
smile;	1
his	1
eyes	1
mocked	1
young	1
Jolyon.	1
“Thanks,”	1
he	1
said.	1
“It’s	1
deuced	1
kind	1
of	1
you.	1
But	1
you’re	1
not	1
the	1
only	1
chaps	1
that	1
can	1
hold	1
on.”	1
He	1
rose.	1
Young	1
Jolyon	1
looked	1
after	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
walked	1
away,	1
and,	1
resting	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
his	1
hand,	1
sighed.	1
In	1
the	1
drowsy,	1
almost	1
empty	1
room	1
the	1
only	1
sounds	1
were	1
the	1
rustle	1
of	1
newspapers,	1
the	1
scraping	1
of	1
matches	1
being	1
struck.	1
He	1
stayed	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
without	1
moving,	1
living	1
over	1
again	1
those	1
days	1
when	1
he,	1
too,	1
had	1
sat	1
long	1
hours	1
watching	1
the	1
clock,	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
minutes	1
to	1
pass	1
—	1
long	1
hours	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
torments	1
of	1
uncertainty,	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
fierce,	1
sweet	1
aching;	1
and	1
the	1
slow,	1
delicious	1
agony	1
of	1
that	1
season	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
its	1
old	1
poignancy.	1
The	1
sight	1
of	1
Bosinney,	1
with	1
his	1
haggard	1
face,	1
and	1
his	1
restless	1
eyes	1
always	1
wandering	1
to	1
the	1
clock,	1
had	1
roused	1
in	1
him	1
a	1
pity,	1
with	1
which	1
was	1
mingled	1
strange,	1
irresistible	1
envy.	1
He	1
knew	1
the	1
signs	1
so	1
well.	1
Whither	1
was	1
he	1
going	1
—	1
to	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
fate?	1
What	1
kind	1
of	1
woman	1
was	1
it	1
who	1
was	1
drawing	1
him	1
to	1
her	1
by	1
that	1
magnetic	1
force	1
which	1
no	1
consideration	1
of	1
honour,	1
no	1
principle,	1
no	1
interest	1
could	1
withstand;	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
only	1
escape	1
was	1
flight.	1
Flight!	1
But	1
why	1
should	1
Bosinney	1
fly?	1
A	1
man	1
fled	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
danger	1
of	1
destroying	1
hearth	1
and	1
home,	1
when	1
there	1
were	1
children,	1
when	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
trampling	1
down	1
ideals,	1
breaking	1
something.	1
But	1
here,	1
so	1
he	1
had	1
heard,	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
broken	1
to	1
his	1
hand.	1
He	1
himself	1
had	1
not	1
fled,	1
nor	1
would	1
he	1
fly	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
all	1
to	1
come	1
over	1
again.	1
Yet	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
further	1
than	1
Bosinney,	1
had	1
broken	1
up	1
his	1
own	1
unhappy	1
home,	1
not	1
someone	1
else’s:	1
And	1
the	1
old	1
saying	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
him:	1
‘A	1
man’s	1
fate	1
lies	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
heart.’	1
In	1
his	1
own	1
heart!	1
The	1
proof	1
of	1
the	1
pudding	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
eating	1
—	1
Bosinney	1
had	1
still	1
to	1
eat	1
his	1
pudding.	1
His	1
thoughts	1
passed	1
to	1
the	1
woman,	1
the	1
woman	1
whom	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know,	1
but	1
the	1
outline	1
of	1
whose	1
story	1
he	1
had	1
heard.	1
An	1
unhappy	1
marriage!	1
No	1
ill-treatment	1
—	1
only	1
that	1
indefinable	1
malaise,	1
that	1
terrible	1
blight	1
which	1
killed	1
all	1
sweetness	1
under	1
Heaven;	1
and	1
so	1
from	1
day	1
to	1
day,	1
from	1
night	1
to	1
night,	1
from	1
week	1
to	1
week,	1
from	1
year	1
to	1
year,	1
till	1
death	1
should	1
end	1
it.	1
But	1
young	1
Jolyon,	1
the	1
bitterness	1
of	1
whose	1
own	1
feelings	1
time	1
had	1
assuaged,	1
saw	1
Soames’	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
too.	1
Whence	1
should	1
a	1
man	1
like	1
his	1
cousin,	1
saturated	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
prejudices	1
and	1
beliefs	1
of	1
his	1
class,	1
draw	1
the	1
insight	1
or	1
inspiration	1
necessary	1
to	1
break	1
up	1
this	1
life?	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
imagination,	1
of	1
projecting	1
himself	1
into	1
the	1
future	1
beyond	1
the	1
unpleasant	1
gossip,	1
sneers,	1
and	1
tattle	1
that	1
followed	1
on	1
such	1
separations,	1
beyond	1
the	1
passing	1
pangs	1
that	1
the	1
lack	1
of	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
her	1
would	1
cause,	1
beyond	1
the	1
grave	1
disapproval	1
of	1
the	1
worthy.	1
But	1
few	1
men,	1
and	1
especially	1
few	1
men	1
of	1
Soames’	1
class,	1
had	1
imagination	1
enough	1
for	1
that.	1
A	1
deal	1
of	1
mortals	1
in	1
this	1
world,	1
and	1
not	1
enough	1
imagination	1
to	1
go	1
round!	1
And	1
sweet	1
Heaven,	1
what	1
a	1
difference	1
between	1
theory	1
and	1
practice;	1
many	1
a	1
man,	1
perhaps	1
even	1
Soames,	1
held	1
chivalrous	1
views	1
on	1
such	1
matters,	1
who	1
when	1
the	1
shoe	1
pinched	1
found	1
a	1
distinguishing	1
factor	1
that	1
made	1
of	1
himself	1
an	1
exception.	1
Then,	1
too,	1
he	1
distrusted	1
his	1
judgment.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
through	1
the	1
experience	1
himself,	1
had	1
tasted	1
too	1
the	1
dregs	1
the	1
bitterness	1
of	1
an	1
unhappy	1
marriage,	1
and	1
how	1
could	1
he	1
take	1
the	1
wide	1
and	1
dispassionate	1
view	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
within	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
battle?	1
His	1
evidence	1
was	1
too	1
first-hand	1
—	1
like	1
the	1
evidence	1
on	1
military	1
matters	1
of	1
a	1
soldier	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
through	1
much	1
active	1
service,	1
against	1
that	1
of	1
civilians	1
who	1
have	1
not	1
suffered	1
the	1
disadvantage	1
of	1
seeing	1
things	1
too	1
close.	1
Most	1
people	1
would	1
consider	1
such	1
a	1
marriage	1
as	1
that	1
of	1
Soames	1
and	1
Irene	1
quite	1
fairly	1
successful;	1
he	1
had	1
money,	1
she	1
had	1
beauty;	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
case	1
for	1
compromise.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
reason	1
why	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
jog	1
along,	1
even	1
if	1
they	1
hated	1
each	1
other.	1
It	1
would	1
not	1
matter	1
if	1
they	1
went	1
their	1
own	1
ways	1
a	1
little	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
decencies	1
were	1
observed	1
—	1
the	1
sanctity	1
of	1
the	1
marriage	1
tie,	1
of	1
the	1
common	1
home,	1
respected.	1
Half	1
the	1
marriages	1
of	1
the	1
upper	1
classes	1
were	1
conducted	1
on	1
these	1
lines:	1
Do	1
not	1
offend	1
the	1
susceptibilities	1
of	1
Society;	1
do	1
not	1
offend	1
the	1
susceptibilities	1
of	1
the	1
Church.	1
To	1
avoid	1
offending	1
these	1
is	1
worth	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
any	1
private	1
feelings.	1
The	1
advantages	1
of	1
the	1
stable	1
home	1
are	1
visible,	1
tangible,	1
so	1
many	1
pieces	1
of	1
property;	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
risk	1
in	1
the	1
statu	1
quo.	1
To	1
break	1
up	1
a	1
home	1
is	1
at	1
the	1
best	1
a	1
dangerous	1
experiment,	1
and	1
selfish	1
into	1
the	1
bargain.	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
case	1
for	1
the	1
defence,	1
and	1
young	1
Jolyon	1
sighed.	1
‘The	1
core	1
of	1
it	1
all,’	1
he	1
thought,	1
‘is	1
property,	1
but	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
people	1
who	1
would	1
not	1
like	1
it	1
put	1
that	1
way.	1
To	1
them	1
it	1
is	1
“the	1
sanctity	1
of	1
the	1
marriage	1
tie”;	1
but	1
the	1
sanctity	1
of	1
the	1
marriage	1
tie	1
is	1
dependent	1
on	1
the	1
sanctity	1
of	1
the	1
family,	1
and	1
the	1
sanctity	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
is	1
dependent	1
on	1
the	1
sanctity	1
of	1
property.	1
And	1
yet	1
I	1
imagine	1
all	1
these	1
people	1
are	1
followers	1
of	1
One	1
who	1
never	1
owned	1
anything.	1
It	1
is	1
curious!	1
And	1
again	1
young	1
Jolyon	1
sighed.	1
‘Am	1
I	1
going	1
on	1
my	1
way	1
home	1
to	1
ask	1
any	1
poor	1
devils	1
I	1
meet	1
to	1
share	1
my	1
dinner,	1
which	1
will	1
then	1
be	1
too	1
little	1
for	1
myself,	1
or,	1
at	1
all	1
events,	1
for	1
my	1
wife,	1
who	1
is	1
necessary	1
to	1
my	1
health	1
and	1
happiness?	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
after	1
all	1
Soames	1
does	1
well	1
to	1
exercise	1
his	1
rights	1
and	1
support	1
by	1
his	1
practice	1
the	1
sacred	1
principle	1
of	1
property	1
which	1
benefits	1
us	1
all,	1
with	1
the	1
exception	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
suffer	1
by	1
the	1
process.’	1
And	1
so	1
he	1
left	1
his	1
chair,	1
threaded	1
his	1
way	1
through	1
the	1
maze	1
of	1
seats,	1
took	1
his	1
hat,	1
and	1
languidly	1
up	1
the	1
hot	1
streets	1
crowded	1
with	1
carriages,	1
reeking	1
with	1
dusty	1
odours,	1
wended	1
his	1
way	1
home.	1
Before	1
reaching	1
Wistaria	1
Avenue	1
he	1
removed	1
old	1
Jolyon’s	1
letter	1
from	1
his	1
pocket,	1
and	1
tearing	1
it	1
carefully	1
into	1
tiny	1
pieces,	1
scattered	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
road.	1
He	1
let	1
himself	1
in	1
with	1
his	1
key,	1
and	1
called	1
his	1
wife’s	1
name.	1
But	1
she	1
had	1
gone	1
out,	1
taking	1
Jolly	1
and	1
Holly,	1
and	1
the	1
house	1
was	1
empty;	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
the	1
dog	1
Balthasar	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
shade	1
snapping	1
at	1
flies.	1
Young	1
Jolyon	1
took	1
his	1
seat	1
there,	1
too,	1
under	1
the	1
pear-tree	1
that	1
bore	1
no	1
fruit.	1
Chapter	1
20	1
Bosinney	1
on	1
Parole	1
The	1
day	1
after	1
the	1
evening	1
at	1
Richmond	1
Soames	1
returned	1
from	1
Henley	1
by	1
a	1
morning	1
train.	1
Not	1
constitutionally	1
interested	1
in	1
amphibious	1
sports,	1
his	1
visit	1
had	1
been	1
one	1
of	1
business	1
rather	1
than	1
pleasure,	1
a	1
client	1
of	1
some	1
importance	1
having	1
asked	1
him	1
down.	1
He	1
went	1
straight	1
to	1
the	1
City,	1
but	1
finding	1
things	1
slack,	1
he	1
left	1
at	1
three	1
o’clock,	1
glad	1
of	1
this	1
chance	1
to	1
get	1
home	1
quietly.	1
Irene	1
did	1
not	1
expect	1
him.	1
Not	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
any	1
desire	1
to	1
spy	1
on	1
her	1
actions,	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
harm	1
in	1
thus	1
unexpectedly	1
surveying	1
the	1
scene.	1
After	1
changing	1
to	1
Park	1
clothes	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
drawing-room.	1
She	1
was	1
sitting	1
idly	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
sofa,	1
her	1
favourite	1
seat;	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
circles	1
under	1
her	1
eyes,	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
slept.	1
He	1
asked:	1
“How	1
is	1
it	1
you’re	1
in?	1
Are	1
you	1
expecting	1
somebody?”	1
“Yes	1
that	1
is,	1
not	1
particularly.”	1
“Who?”	1
“Mr.	1
Bosinney	1
said	1
he	1
might	1
come.”	1
“Bosinney.	1
He	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
work.”	1
To	1
this	1
she	1
made	1
no	1
answer.	1
“Well,”	1
said	1
Soames,	1
“I	1
want	1
you	1
to	1
come	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
Stores	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
we’ll	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
Park.”	1
“I	1
don’t	1
want	1
to	1
go	1
out;	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
headache.”	1
Soames	1
replied:	1
“If	1
ever	1
I	1
want	1
you	1
to	1
do	1
anything,	1
you’ve	1
always	1
got	1
a	1
headache.	1
It’ll	1
do	1
you	1
good	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
sit	1
under	1
the	1
trees.”	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
answer.	1
Soames	1
was	1
silent	1
for	1
some	1
minutes;	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
said:	1
“I	1
don’t	1
know	1
what	1
your	1
idea	1
of	1
a	1
wife’s	1
duty	1
is.	1
I	1
never	1
have	1
known!”	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
expected	1
her	1
to	1
reply,	1
but	1
she	1
did.	1
“I	1
have	1
tried	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
you	1
want;	1
it’s	1
not	1
my	1
fault	1
that	1
I	1
haven’t	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
put	1
my	1
heart	1
into	1
it.”	1
“Whose	1
fault	1
is	1
it,	1
then?”	1
He	1
watched	1
her	1
askance.	1
“Before	1
we	1
were	1
married	1
you	1
promised	1
to	1
let	1
me	1
go	1
if	1
our	1
marriage	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
success.	1
Is	1
it	1
a	1
success?”	1
Soames	1
frowned.	1
“Success,”	1
he	1
stammered	1
—“it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
success	1
if	1
you	1
behaved	1
yourself	1
properly!”	1
“I	1
have	1
tried,”	1
said	1
Irene.	1
“Will	1
you	1
let	1
me	1
go?”	1
Soames	1
turned	1
away.	1
Secretly	1
alarmed,	1
he	1
took	1
refuge	1
in	1
bluster.	1
“Let	1
you	1
go?	1
You	1
don’t	1
know	1
what	1
you’re	1
talking	1
about.	1
Let	1
you	1
go?	1
How	1
can	1
I	1
let	1
you	1
go?	1
We’re	1
married,	1
aren’t	1
we?	1
Then,	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
talking	1
about?	1
For	1
God’s	1
sake,	1
don’t	1
let’s	1
have	1
any	1
of	1
this	1
sort	1
of	1
nonsense!	1
Get	1
your	1
hat	1
on,	1
and	1
come	1
and	1
sit	1
in	1
the	1
Park.”	1
“Then,	1
you	1
won’t	1
let	1
me	1
go?”	1
He	1
felt	1
her	1
eyes	1
resting	1
on	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
strange,	1
touching	1
look.	1
“Let	1
you	1
go!”	1
he	1
said;	1
“and	1
what	1
on	1
earth	1
would	1
you	1
do	1
with	1
yourself	1
if	1
I	1
did?	1
You’ve	1
got	1
no	1
money!”	1
“I	1
could	1
manage	1
somehow.”	1
He	1
took	1
a	1
swift	1
turn	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room;	1
then	1
came	1
and	1
stood	1
before	1
her.	1
“Understand,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“once	1
and	1
for	1
all,	1
I	1
won’t	1
have	1
you	1
say	1
this	1
sort	1
of	1
thing.	1
Go	1
and	1
get	1
your	1
hat	1
on!”	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
move.	1
“I	1
suppose,”	1
said	1
Soames,	1
“you	1
don’t	1
want	1
to	1
miss	1
Bosinney	1
if	1
he	1
comes!”	1
Irene	1
got	1
up	1
slowly	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
She	1
came	1
down	1
with	1
her	1
hat	1
on.	1
They	1
went	1
out.	1
In	1
the	1
Park,	1
the	1
motley	1
hour	1
of	1
mid-afternoon,	1
when	1
foreigners	1
and	1
other	1
pathetic	1
folk	1
drive,	1
thinking	1
themselves	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
fashion,	1
had	1
passed;	1
the	1
right,	1
the	1
proper,	1
hour	1
had	1
come,	1
was	1
nearly	1
gone,	1
before	1
Soames	1
and	1
Irene	1
seated	1
themselves	1
under	1
the	1
Achilles	1
statue.	1
It	1
was	1
some	1
time	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
enjoyed	1
her	1
company	1
in	1
the	1
Park.	1
That	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
past	1
delights	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
two	1
seasons	1
of	1
his	1
married	1
life,	1
when	1
to	1
feel	1
himself	1
the	1
possessor	1
of	1
this	1
gracious	1
creature	1
before	1
all	1
London	1
had	1
been	1
his	1
greatest,	1
though	1
secret,	1
pride.	1
How	1
many	1
afternoons	1
had	1
he	1
not	1
sat	1
beside	1
her,	1
extremely	1
neat,	1
with	1
light	1
grey	1
gloves	1
and	1
faint,	1
supercilious	1
smile,	1
nodding	1
to	1
acquaintances,	1
and	1
now	1
and	1
again	1
removing	1
his	1
hat.	1
His	1
light	1
grey	1
gloves	1
were	1
still	1
on	1
his	1
hands,	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
lips	1
his	1
smile	1
sardonic,	1
but	1
where	1
the	1
feeling	1
in	1
his	1
heart?	1
The	1
seats	1
were	1
emptying	1
fast,	1
but	1
still	1
he	1
kept	1
her	1
there,	1
silent	1
and	1
pale,	1
as	1
though	1
to	1
work	1
out	1
a	1
secret	1
punishment.	1
Once	1
or	1
twice	1
he	1
made	1
some	1
comment,	1
and	1
she	1
bent	1
her	1
head,	1
or	1
answered	1
“Yes”	1
with	1
a	1
tired	1
smile.	1
Along	1
the	1
rails	1
a	1
man	1
was	1
walking	1
so	1
fast	1
that	1
people	1
stared	1
after	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
passed.	1
“Look	1
at	1
that	1
ass!”	1
said	1
Soames;	1
“he	1
must	1
be	1
mad	1
to	1
walk	1
like	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
heat!”	1
He	1
turned;	1
Irene	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
rapid	1
movement.	1
“Hallo!”	1
he	1
said:	1
“it’s	1
our	1
friend	1
the	1
Buccaneer!”	1
And	1
he	1
sat	1
still,	1
with	1
his	1
sneering	1
smile,	1
conscious	1
that	1
Irene	1
was	1
sitting	1
still,	1
and	1
smiling	1
too.	1
“Will	1
she	1
bow	1
to	1
him?”	1
he	1
thought.	1
But	1
she	1
made	1
no	1
sign.	1
Bosinney	1
reached	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
rails,	1
and	1
came	1
walking	1
back	1
amongst	1
the	1
chairs,	1
quartering	1
his	1
ground	1
like	1
a	1
pointer.	1
When	1
he	1
saw	1
them	1
he	1
stopped	1
dead,	1
and	1
raised	1
his	1
hat.	1
The	1
smile	1
never	1
left	1
Soames’	1
face;	1
he	1
also	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
hat.	1
Bosinney	1
came	1
up,	1
looking	1
exhausted,	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
after	1
hard	1
physical	1
exercise;	1
the	1
sweat	1
stood	1
in	1
drops	1
on	1
his	1
brow,	1
and	1
Soames’	1
smile	1
seemed	1
to	1
say:	1
“You’ve	1
had	1
a	1
trying	1
time,	1
my	1
friend	1
.	4
..What	1
are	1
you	1
doing	1
in	1
the	1
Park?”	1
he	1
asked.	1
“We	1
thought	1
you	1
despised	1
such	1
frivolity!”	1
Bosinney	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
hear;	1
he	1
made	1
his	1
answer	1
to	1
Irene:	1
“I’ve	1
been	1
round	1
to	1
your	1
place;	1
I	1
hoped	1
I	1
should	1
find	1
you	1
in.”	1
Somebody	1
tapped	1
Soames	1
on	1
the	1
back,	1
and	1
spoke	1
to	1
him;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
exchange	1
of	1
those	1
platitudes	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder,	1
he	1
missed	1
her	1
answer,	1
and	1
took	1
a	1
resolution.	1
“We’re	1
just	1
going	1
in,”	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Bosinney;	1
“you’d	1
better	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
dinner	1
with	1
us.”	1
Into	1
that	1
invitation	1
he	1
put	1
a	1
strange	1
bravado,	1
a	1
stranger	1
pathos:	1
“You,	1
can’t	1
deceive	1
me,”	1
his	1
look	1
and	1
voice	1
seemed	1
saying,	1
“but	1
see	1
—	1
I	1
trust	1
you	1
—	1
I’m	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
you!”	1
They	1
started	1
back	1
to	1
Montpellier	1
Square	1
together,	1
Irene	1
between	1
them.	1
In	1
the	1
crowded	1
streets	1
Soames	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
front.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
listen	1
to	1
their	1
conversation;	1
the	1
strange	1
resolution	1
of	1
trustfulness	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
seemed	1
to	1
animate	1
even	1
his	1
secret	1
conduct.	1
Like	1
a	1
gambler,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself:	1
‘It’s	1
a	1
card	1
I	1
dare	1
not	1
throw	1
away	1
—	1
I	1
must	1
play	1
it	1
for	1
what	1
it’s	1
worth.	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
too	1
many	1
chances.’	1
He	1
dressed	1
slowly,	1
heard	1
her	1
leave	1
her	1
room	1
and	1
go	1
downstairs,	1
and,	1
for	1
full	1
five	1
minutes	1
after,	1
dawdled	1
about	1
in	1
his	1
dressing-room.	1
Then	1
he	1
went	1
down,	1
purposely	1
shutting	1
the	1
door	1
loudly	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
coming.	1
He	1
found	1
them	1
standing	1
by	1
the	1
hearth,	1
perhaps	1
talking,	1
perhaps	1
not;	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
say.	1
He	1
played	1
his	1
part	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
farce,	1
the	1
long	1
evening	1
through	1
—	1
his	1
manner	1
to	1
his	1
guest	1
more	1
friendly	1
than	1
it	1
had	1
ever	1
been	1
before;	1
and	1
when	1
at	1
last	1
Bosinney	1
went,	1
he	1
said:	1
“You	1
must	1
come	1
again	1
soon;	1
Irene	1
likes	1
to	1
have	1
you	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
the	1
house!”	1
Again	1
his	1
voice	1
had	1
the	1
strange	1
bravado	1
and	1
the	1
stranger	1
pathos;	1
but	1
his	1
hand	1
was	1
cold	1
as	1
ice.	1
Loyal	1
to	1
his	1
resolution,	1
he	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
their	1
parting,	1
turned	1
away	1
from	1
his	1
wife	1
as	1
she	1
stood	1
under	1
the	1
hanging	1
lamp	1
to	1
say	1
good-night	1
—	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
her	1
golden	1
head	1
shining	1
so	1
under	1
the	1
light,	1
of	1
her	1
smiling	1
mournful	1
lips;	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
Bosinney’s	1
eyes	1
looking	1
at	1
her,	1
so	1
like	1
a	1
dog’s	1
looking	1
at	1
its	1
master.	1
And	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
bed	1
with	1
the	1
certainty	1
that	1
Bosinney	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
his	1
wife.	1
The	1
summer	1
night	1
was	1
hot,	1
so	1
hot	1
and	1
still	1
that	1
through	1
every	1
opened	1
window	1
came	1
in	1
but	1
hotter	1
air.	1
For	1
long	1
hours	1
he	1
lay	1
listening	1
to	1
her	1
breathing.	1
She	1
could	1
sleep,	1
but	1
he	1
must	1
lie	1
awake.	1
And,	1
lying	1
awake,	1
he	1
hardened	1
himself	1
to	1
play	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
serene	1
and	1
trusting	1
husband.	1
In	1
the	1
small	1
hours	1
he	1
slipped	1
out	1
of	1
bed,	1
and	1
passing	1
into	1
his	1
dressing-room,	1
leaned	1
by	1
the	1
open	1
window.	1
He	1
could	1
hardly	1
breathe.	1
A	1
night	1
four	1
years	1
ago	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
him	1
—	1
the	1
night	1
but	1
one	1
before	1
his	1
marriage;	1
as	1
hot	1
and	1
stifling	1
as	1
this.	1
He	1
remembered	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
lain	1
in	1
a	1
long	1
cane	1
chair	1
in	1
the	1
window	1
of	1
his	1
sitting-room	1
off	1
Victoria	1
Street.	1
Down	1
below	1
in	1
a	1
side	1
street	1
a	1
man	1
had	1
banged	1
at	1
a	1
door,	1
a	1
woman	1
had	1
cried	1
out;	1
he	1
remembered,	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
now,	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
scuffle,	1
the	1
slam	1
of	1
the	1
door,	1
the	1
dead	1
silence	1
that	1
followed.	1
And	1
then	1
the	1
early	1
water-cart,	1
cleansing	1
the	1
reek	1
of	1
the	1
streets,	1
had	1
approached	1
through	1
the	1
strange-seeming,	1
useless	1
lamp-light;	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
hear	1
again	1
its	1
rumble,	1
nearer	1
and	1
nearer,	1
till	1
it	1
passed	1
and	1
slowly	1
died	1
away.	1
He	1
leaned	1
far	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
dressing-room	1
window	1
over	1
the	1
little	1
court	1
below,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
first	1
light	1
spread.	1
The	1
outlines	1
of	1
dark	1
walls	1
and	1
roofs	1
were	1
blurred	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
then	1
came	1
out	1
sharper	1
than	1
before.	1
He	1
remembered	1
how	1
that	1
other	1
night	1
he	1
had	1
watched	1
the	1
lamps	1
paling	1
all	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
Victoria	1
Street;	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
hurried	1
on	1
his	1
clothes	1
and	1
gone	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
street,	1
down	1
past	1
houses	1
and	1
squares,	1
to	1
the	1
street	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
staying,	1
and	1
there	1
had	1
stood	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
house,	1
as	1
still	1
and	1
grey	1
as	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
dead	1
man.	1
And	1
suddenly	1
it	1
shot	1
through	1
his	1
mind;	1
like	1
a	1
sick	1
man’s	1
fancy:	1
What’s	1
he	1
doing?	1
—	1
that	1
fellow	1
who	1
haunts	1
me,	1
who	1
was	1
here	1
this	1
evening,	1
who’s	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
my	1
wife	1
—	1
prowling	1
out	1
there,	1
perhaps,	1
looking	1
for	1
her	1
as	1
I	1
know	1
he	1
was	1
looking	1
for	1
her	1
this	1
afternoon;	1
watching	1
my	1
house	1
now,	1
for	1
all	1
I	1
can	1
tell!	1
He	1
stole	1
across	1
the	1
landing	1
to	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
stealthily	1
drew	1
aside	1
a	1
blind,	1
and	1
raised	1
a	1
window.	1
The	1
grey	1
light	1
clung	1
about	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
the	1
square,	1
as	1
though	1
Night,	1
like	1
a	1
great	1
downy	1
moth,	1
had	1
brushed	1
them	1
with	1
her	1
wings.	1
The	1
lamps	1
were	1
still	1
alight,	1
all	1
pale,	1
but	1
not	1
a	1
soul	1
stirred	1
—	1
no	1
living	1
thing	1
in	1
sight.	1
Yet	1
suddenly,	1
very	1
faint,	1
far	1
off	1
in	1
the	1
deathly	1
stillness,	1
he	1
heard	1
a	1
cry	1
writhing,	1
like	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
some	1
wandering	1
soul	1
barred	1
out	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
crying	1
for	1
its	1
happiness.	1
There	1
it	1
was	1
again	1
—	1
again!	1
Soames	1
shut	1
the	1
window,	1
shuddering.	1
Then	1
he	1
thought:	1
‘Ah!	1
it’s	1
only	1
the	1
peacocks,	1
across	1
the	1
water.’	1
Chapter	1

June	1
Pays	1
Some	1
Calls	1
Jolyon	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
narrow	1
hall	1
at	1
Broadstairs,	1
inhaling	1
that	1
odour	1
of	1
oilcloth	1
and	1
herrings	1
which	1
permeates	1
all	1
respectable	1
seaside	1
lodging-houses.	1
On	1
a	1
chair	1
—	1
a	1
shiny	1
leather	1
chair,	1
displaying	1
its	1
horsehair	1
through	1
a	1
hole	1
in	1
the	1
top	1
left-hand	1
corner	1
—	1
stood	1
a	1
black	1
despatch	1
case.	1
This	1
he	1
was	1
filling	1
with	1
papers,	1
with	1
the	1
Times,	1
and	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
Eau-de	1
Cologne.	1
He	1
had	1
meetings	1
that	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
‘Globular	1
Gold	1
Concessions’	1
and	1
the	1
‘New	1
Colliery	1
Company,	1
Limited,’	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
up,	1
for	1
he	1
never	1
missed	1
a	1
Board;	1
to	1
‘miss	1
a	1
Board’	1
would	1
be	1
one	1
more	1
piece	1
of	1
evidence	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
growing	1
old,	1
and	1
this	1
his	1
jealous	1
Forsyte	1
spirit	1
could	1
not	1
bear.	1
His	1
eyes,	1
as	1
he	1
filled	1
that	1
black	1
despatch	1
case,	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
at	1
any	1
moment	1
they	1
might	1
blaze	1
up	1
with	1
anger.	1
So	1
gleams	1
the	1
eye	1
of	1
a	1
schoolboy,	1
baited	1
by	1
a	1
ring	1
of	1
his	1
companions;	1
but	1
he	1
controls	1
himself,	1
deterred	1
by	1
the	1
fearful	1
odds	1
against	1
him.	1
And	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
controlled	1
himself,	1
keeping	1
down,	1
with	1
his	1
masterful	1
restraint	1
now	1
slowly	1
wearing	1
out,	1
the	1
irritation	1
fostered	1
in	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
conditions	1
of	1
his	1
life.	1
He	1
had	1
received	1
from	1
his	1
son	1
an	1
unpractical	1
letter,	1
in	1
which	1
by	1
rambling	1
generalities	1
the	1
boy	1
seemed	1
trying	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
answering	1
a	1
plain	1
question.	1
‘I’ve	1
seen	1
Bosinney,’	1
he	1
said;	1
‘he	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
criminal.	1
The	1
more	1
I	1
see	1
of	1
people	1
the	1
more	1
I	1
am	1
convinced	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
never	1
good	1
or	1
bad	1
—	1
merely	1
comic,	1
or	1
pathetic.	1
You	1
probably	1
don’t	1
agree	1
with	1
me!’	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
did	1
not;	1
he	1
considered	1
it	1
cynical	1
to	1
so	1
express	1
oneself;	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
reached	1
that	1
point	1
of	1
old	1
age	1
when	1
even	1
Forsytes,	1
bereft	1
of	1
those	1
illusions	1
and	1
principles	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
cherished	1
carefully	1
for	1
practical	1
purposes	1
but	1
never	1
believed	1
in,	1
bereft	1
of	1
all	1
corporeal	1
enjoyment,	1
stricken	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
heart	1
by	1
having	1
nothing	1
left	1
to	1
hope	1
for	1
—	1
break	1
through	1
the	1
barriers	1
of	1
reserve	1
and	1
say	1
things	1
they	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
believed	1
themselves	1
capable	1
of	1
saying.	1
Perhaps	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
in	1
‘goodness’	1
and	1
‘badness’	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
his	1
son;	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
said:	1
He	1
didn’t	1
know	1
—	1
couldn’t	1
tell;	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
something	1
in	1
it;	1
and	1
why,	1
by	1
an	1
unnecessary	1
expression	1
of	1
disbelief,	1
deprive	1
yourself	1
of	1
possible	1
advantage?	1
Accustomed	1
to	1
spend	1
his	1
holidays	1
among	1
the	1
mountains,	1
though	1
(like	1
a	1
true	1
Forsyte)	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
attempted	1
anything	1
too	1
adventurous	1
or	1
too	1
foolhardy,	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
passionately	1
fond	1
of	1
them.	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
wonderful	1
view	1
(mentioned	1
in	1
Baedeker	1
—‘fatiguing	1
but	1
repaying’)—	1
was	1
disclosed	1
to	1
him	1
after	1
the	1
effort	1
of	1
the	1
climb,	1
he	1
had	1
doubtless	1
felt	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
some	1
great,	1
dignified	1
principle	1
crowning	1
the	1
chaotic	1
strivings,	1
the	1
petty	1
precipices,	1
and	1
ironic	1
little	1
dark	1
chasms	1
of	1
life.	1
This	1
was	1
as	1
near	1
to	1
religion,	1
perhaps,	1
as	1
his	1
practical	1
spirit	1
had	1
ever	1
gone.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
many	1
years	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
the	1
mountains.	1
He	1
had	1
taken	1
June	1
there	1
two	1
seasons	1
running,	1
after	1
his	1
wife	1
died,	1
and	1
had	1
realized	1
bitterly	1
that	1
his	1
walking	1
days	1
were	1
over.	1
To	1
that	1
old	1
mountain	1
—	1
given	1
confidence	1
in	1
a	1
supreme	1
order	1
of	1
things	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
a	1
stranger.	1
He	1
knew	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
old,	1
yet	1
he	1
felt	1
young;	1
and	1
this	1
troubled	1
him.	1
It	1
troubled	1
and	1
puzzled	1
him,	1
too,	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
he,	1
who	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
so	1
careful,	1
should	1
be	1
father	1
and	1
grandfather	1
to	1
such	1
as	1
seemed	1
born	1
to	1
disaster.	1
He	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
say	1
against	1
Jo	1
—	1
who	1
could	1
say	1
anything	1
against	1
the	1
boy,	1
an	1
amiable	1
chap?	1
—	1
but	1
his	1
position	1
was	1
deplorable,	1
and	1
this	1
business	1
of	1
June’s	1
nearly	1
as	1
bad.	1
It	1
seemed	1
like	1
a	1
fatality,	1
and	1
a	1
fatality	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
no	1
man	1
of	1
his	1
character	1
could	1
either	1
understand	1
or	1
put	1
up	1
with.	1
In	1
writing	1
to	1
his	1
son	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
really	1
hope	1
that	1
anything	1
would	1
come	1
of	1
it.	1
Since	1
the	1
ball	1
at	1
Roger’s	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
too	1
clearly	1
how	1
the	1
land	1
lay	1
—	1
he	1
could	1
put	1
two	1
and	1
two	1
together	1
quicker	1
than	1
most	1
men	1
—	1
and,	1
with	1
the	1
example	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
son	1
before	1
his	1
eyes,	1
knew	1
better	1
than	1
any	1
Forsyte	1
of	1
them	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
pale	1
flame	1
singes	1
men’s	1
wings	1
whether	1
they	1
will	1
or	1
no.	1
In	1
the	1
days	1
before	1
June’s	1
engagement,	1
when	1
she	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Soames	1
were	1
always	1
together,	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
enough	1
of	1
Irene	1
to	1
feel	1
the	1
spell	1
she	1
cast	1
over	1
men.	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
flirt,	1
not	1
even	1
a	1
coquette	1
—	1
words	1
dear	1
to	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
his	1
generation,	1
which	1
loved	1
to	1
define	1
things	1
by	1
a	1
good,	1
broad,	1
inadequate	1
word	1
—	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
dangerous.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
say	1
why.	1
Tell	1
him	1
of	1
a	1
quality	1
innate	1
in	1
some	1
women	1
—	1
a	1
seductive	1
power	1
beyond	1
their	1
own	1
control!	1
He	1
would	1
but	1
answer:	1
‘Humbug!’	1
She	1
was	1
dangerous,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
it.	1
He	1
wanted	1
to	1
close	1
his	1
eyes	1
to	1
that	1
affair.	1
If	1
it	1
was,	1
it	1
was;	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
hear	1
any	1
more	1
about	1
it	1
—	1
he	1
only	1
wanted	1
to	1
save	1
June’s	1
position	1
and	1
her	1
peace	1
of	1
mind.	1
He	1
still	1
hoped	1
she	1
might	1
once	1
more	1
become	1
a	1
comfort	1
to	1
himself.	1
And	1
so	1
he	1
had	1
written.	1
He	1
got	1
little	1
enough	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
answer.	1
As	1
to	1
what	1
young	1
Jolyon	1
had	1
made	1
of	1
the	1
interview,	1
there	1
was	1
practically	1
only	1
the	1
queer	1
sentence:	1
‘I	1
gather	1
that	1
he’s	1
in	1
the	1
stream.’	1
The	1
stream!	1
What	1
stream?	1
What	1
was	1
this	1
new-fangled	1
way	1
of	1
talking?	1
He	1
sighed,	1
and	1
folded	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
the	1
papers	1
under	1
the	1
flap	1
of	1
the	1
bag;	1
he	1
knew	1
well	1
enough	1
what	1
was	1
meant.	1
June	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
dining-room,	1
and	1
helped	1
him	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
summer	1
coat.	1
From	1
her	1
costume,	1
and	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
little	1
resolute	1
face,	1
he	1
saw	1
at	1
once	1
what	1
was	1
coming.	1
“I’m	1
going	1
with	1
you,”	1
she	1
said.	1
“Nonsense,	1
my	1
dear;	1
I	1
go	1
straight	1
into	1
the	1
City.	1
I	1
can’t	1
have	1
you	1
racketting	1
about!”	1
“I	1
must	1
see	1
old	1
Mrs.	1
Smeech.”	1
“Oh,	1
your	1
precious	1
‘lame	1
ducks!”	1
grumbled	1
out	1
old	1
Jolyon.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
her	1
excuse,	1
but	1
ceased	1
his	1
opposition.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
doing	1
anything	1
with	1
that	1
pertinacity	1
of	1
hers.	1
At	1
Victoria	1
he	1
put	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
carriage	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
ordered	1
for	1
himself	1
—	1
a	1
characteristic	1
action,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
petty	1
selfishnesses.	1
“Now,	1
don’t	1
you	1
go	1
tiring	1
yourself,	1
my	1
darling,”	1
he	1
said,	1
and	1
took	1
a	1
cab	1
on	1
into	1
the	1
city.	1
June	1
went	1
first	1
to	1
a	1
back-street	1
in	1
Paddington,	1
where	1
Mrs.	1
Smeech,	1
her	1
‘lame	1
duck,’	1
lived	1
—	1
an	1
aged	1
person,	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
charring	1
interest;	1
but	1
after	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
spent	1
in	1
hearing	1
her	1
habitually	1
lamentable	1
recital,	1
and	1
dragooning	1
her	1
into	1
temporary	1
comfort,	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
Stanhope	1
Gate.	1
The	1
great	1
house	1
was	1
closed	1
and	1
dark.	1
She	1
had	1
decided	1
to	1
learn	1
something	1
at	1
all	1
costs.	1
It	1
was	1
better	1
to	1
face	1
the	1
worst,	1
and	1
have	1
it	1
over.	1
And	1
this	1
was	1
her	1
plan:	1
To	1
go	1
first	1
to	1
Phil’s	1
aunt,	1
Mrs.	1
Baynes,	1
and,	1
failing	1
information	1
there,	1
to	1
Irene	1
herself.	1
She	1
had	1
no	1
clear	1
notion	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
would	1
gain	1
by	1
these	1
visits.	1
At	1
three	1
o’clock	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
Lowndes	1
Square.	1
With	1
a	1
woman’s	1
instinct	1
when	1
trouble	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
faced,	1
she	1
had	1
put	1
on	1
her	1
best	1
frock,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
battle	1
with	1
a	1
glance	1
as	1
courageous	1
as	1
old	1
Jolyon’s	1
itself.	1
Her	1
tremors	1
had	1
passed	1
into	1
eagerness.	1
Mrs.	1
Baynes,	1
Bosinney’s	1
aunt	1
(Louisa	1
was	1
her	1
name),	1
was	1
in	1
her	1
kitchen	1
when	1
June	1
was	1
announced,	1
organizing	1
the	1
cook,	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
an	1
excellent	1
housewife,	1
and,	1
as	1
Baynes	1
always	1
said,	1
there	1
was	1
‘a	1
lot	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
dinner.’	1
He	1
did	1
his	1
best	1
work	1
after	1
dinner.	1
It	1
was	1
Baynes	1
who	1
built	1
that	1
remarkably	1
fine	1
row	1
of	1
tall	1
crimson	1
houses	1
in	1
Kensington	1
which	1
compete	1
with	1
so	1
many	1
others	1
for	1
the	1
title	1
of	1
‘the	1
ugliest	1
in	1
London.’	1
On	1
hearing	1
June’s	1
name,	1
she	1
went	1
hurriedly	1
to	1
her	1
bedroom,	1
and,	1
taking	1
two	1
large	1
bracelets	1
from	1
a	1
red	1
morocco	1
case	1
in	1
a	1
locked	1
drawer,	1
put	1
them	1
on	1
her	1
white	1
wrists	1
—	1
for	1
she	1
possessed	1
in	1
a	1
remarkable	1
degree	1
that	1
‘sense	1
of	1
property,’	1
which,	1
as	1
we	1
know,	1
is	1
the	1
touchstone	1
of	1
Forsyteism,	1
and	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
good	1
morality.	1
Her	1
figure,	1
of	1
medium	1
height	1
and	1
broad	1
build,	1
with	1
a	1
tendency	1
to	1
embonpoint,	1
was	1
reflected	1
by	1
the	1
mirror	1
of	1
her	1
whitewood	1
wardrobe,	1
in	1
a	1
gown	1
made	1
under	1
her	1
own	1
organization,	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
half-tints,	1
reminiscent	1
of	1
the	1
distempered	1
walls	1
of	1
corridors	1
in	1
large	1
hotels.	1
She	1
raised	1
her	1
hands	1
to	1
her	1
hair,	1
which	1
she	1
wore	1
a	1
la	1
Princesse	1
de	1
Galles,	1
and	1
touched	1
it	1
here	1
and	1
there,	1
settling	1
it	1
more	1
firmly	1
on	1
her	1
head,	1
and	1
her	1
eyes	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
an	1
unconscious	1
realism,	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
were	1
looking	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
one	1
of	1
life’s	1
sordid	1
facts,	1
and	1
making	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
it.	1
In	1
youth	1
her	1
cheeks	1
had	1
been	1
of	1
cream	1
and	1
roses,	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
mottled	1
now	1
by	1
middle-age,	1
and	1
again	1
that	1
hard,	1
ugly	1
directness	1
came	1
into	1
her	1
eyes	1
as	1
she	1
dabbed	1
a	1
powder-puff	1
across	1
her	1
forehead.	1
Putting	1
the	1
puff	1
down,	1
she	1
stood	1
quite	1
still	1
before	1
the	1
glass,	1
arranging	1
a	1
smile	1
over	1
her	1
high,	1
important	1
nose,	1
her,	1
chin,	1
(never	1
large,	1
and	1
now	1
growing	1
smaller	1
with	1
the	1
increase	1
of	1
her	1
neck),	1
her	1
thin-lipped,	1
down-drooping	1
mouth.	1
Quickly,	1
not	1
to	1
lose	1
the	1
effect,	1
she	1
grasped	1
her	1
skirts	1
strongly	1
in	1
both	1
hands,	1
and	1
went	1
downstairs.	1
She	1
had	1
been	1
hoping	1
for	1
this	1
visit	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
past.	1
Whispers	1
had	1
reached	1
her	1
that	1
things	1
were	1
not	1
all	1
right	1
between	1
her	1
nephew	1
and	1
his	1
fiancee.	1
Neither	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
been	1
near	1
her	1
for	1
weeks.	1
She	1
had	1
asked	1
Phil	1
to	1
dinner	1
many	1
times;	1
his	1
invariable	1
answer	1
had	1
been	1
‘Too	1
busy.’	1
Her	1
instinct	1
was	1
alarmed,	1
and	1
the	1
instinct	1
in	1
such	1
matters	1
of	1
this	1
excellent	1
woman	1
was	1
keen.	1
She	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
Forsyte;	1
in	1
young	1
Jolyon’s	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
word,	1
she	1
certainly	1
had	1
that	1
privilege,	1
and	1
merits	1
description	1
as	1
such.	1
She	1
had	1
married	1
off	1
her	1
three	1
daughters	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
people	1
said	1
was	1
beyond	1
their	1
deserts,	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
the	1
professional	1
plainness	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
found,	1
as	1
a	1
rule,	1
among	1
the	1
female	1
kind	1
of	1
the	1
more	1
legal	1
callings.	1
Her	1
name	1
was	1
upon	1
the	1
committees	1
of	1
numberless	1
charities	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
Church-dances,	1
theatricals,	1
or	1
bazaars	1
—	1
and	1
she	1
never	1
lent	1
her	1
name	1
unless	1
sure	1
beforehand	1
that	1
everything	1
had	1
been	1
thoroughly	1
organized.	1
She	1
believed,	1
as	1
she	1
often	1
said,	1
in	1
putting	1
things	1
on	1
a	1
commercial	1
basis;	1
the	1
proper	1
function	1
of	1
the	1
Church,	1
of	1
charity,	1
indeed,	1
of	1
everything,	1
was	1
to	1
strengthen	1
the	1
fabric	1
of	1
‘Society.’	1
Individual	1
action,	1
therefore,	1
she	1
considered	1
immoral.	1
Organization	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
thing,	1
for	1
by	1
organization	1
alone	1
could	1
you	1
feel	1
sure	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
getting	1
a	1
return	1
for	1
your	1
money.	1
Organization	1
—	1
and	1
again,	1
organization!	1
And	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
what	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
called	1
her	1
—“a	1
‘dab’	1
at	1
that”—	1
he	1
went	1
further,	1
he	1
called	1
her	1
“a	1
humbug.”	1
The	1
enterprises	1
to	1
which	1
she	1
lent	1
her	1
name	1
were	1
organized	1
so	1
admirably	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
time	1
the	1
takings	1
were	1
handed	1
over,	1
they	1
were	1
indeed	1
skim	1
milk	1
divested	1
of	1
all	1
cream	1
of	1
human	1
kindness.	1
But	1
as	1
she	1
often	1
justly	1
remarked,	1
sentiment	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
deprecated.	1
She	1
was,	1
in	1
fact,	1
a	1
little	1
academic.	1
This	1
great	1
and	1
good	1
woman,	1
so	1
highly	1
thought	1
of	1
in	1
ecclesiastical	1
circles,	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
principal	1
priestesses	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
Forsyteism,	1
keeping	1
alive	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
a	1
sacred	1
flame	1
to	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
Property,	1
whose	1
altar	1
is	1
inscribed	1
with	1
those	1
inspiring	1
words:	1
‘Nothing	1
for	1
nothing,	1
and	1
really	1
remarkably	1
little	1
for	1
sixpence.’	1
When	1
she	1
entered	1
a	1
room	1
it	1
was	1
felt	1
that	1
something	1
substantial	1
had	1
come	1
in,	1
which	1
was	1
probably	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
her	1
popularity	1
as	1
a	1
patroness.	1
People	1
liked	1
something	1
substantial	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
paid	1
money	1
for	1
it;	1
and	1
they	1
would	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
—	1
surrounded	1
by	1
her	1
staff	1
in	1
charity	1
ballrooms,	1
with	1
her	1
high	1
nose	1
and	1
her	1
broad,	1
square	1
figure,	1
attired	1
in	1
an	1
uniform	1
covered	1
with	1
sequins	1
—	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
were	1
a	1
general.	1
The	1
only	1
thing	1
against	1
her	1
was	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
double	1
name.	1
She	1
was	1
a	1
power	1
in	1
upper	1
middle-class	1
society,	1
with	1
its	1
hundred	1
sets	1
and	1
circles,	1
all	1
intersecting	1
on	1
the	1
common	1
battlefield	1
of	1
charity	1
functions,	1
and	1
on	1
that	1
battlefield	1
brushing	1
skirts	1
so	1
pleasantly	1
with	1
the	1
skirts	1
of	1
Society	1
with	1
the	1
capital	1
‘S.’	1
She	1
was	1
a	1
power	1
in	1
society	1
with	1
the	1
smaller	1
‘s,’	1
that	1
larger,	1
more	1
significant,	1
and	1
more	1
powerful	1
body,	1
where	1
the	1
commercially	1
Christian	1
institutions,	1
maxims,	1
and	1
‘principle,’	1
which	1
Mrs.	1
Baynes	1
embodied,	1
were	1
real	1
life-blood,	1
circulating	1
freely,	1
real	1
business	1
currency,	1
not	1
merely	1
the	1
sterilized	1
imitation	1
that	1
flowed	1
in	1
the	1
veins	1
of	1
smaller	1
Society	1
with	1
the	1
larger	1
‘S.’	1
People	1
who	1
knew	1
her	1
felt	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
sound	1
—	1
a	1
sound	1
woman,	1
who	1
never	1
gave	1
herself	1
away,	1
nor	1
anything	1
else,	1
if	1
she	1
could	1
possibly	1
help	1
it.	1
She	1
had	1
been	1
on	1
the	1
worst	1
sort	1
of	1
terms	1
with	1
Bosinney’s	1
father,	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
infrequently	1
made	1
her	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
an	1
unpardonable	1
ridicule.	1
She	1
alluded	1
to	1
him	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
gone	1
as	1
her	1
‘poor,	1
dear,	1
irreverend	1
brother.’	1
She	1
greeted	1
June	1
with	1
the	1
careful	1
effusion	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
mistress,	1
a	1
little	1
afraid	1
of	1
her	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
her	1
eminence	1
in	1
the	1
commercial	1
and	1
Christian	1
world	1
could	1
be	1
afraid	1
—	1
for	1
so	1
slight	1
a	1
girl	1
June	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
dignity,	1
the	1
fearlessness	1
of	1
her	1
eyes	1
gave	1
her	1
that.	1
And	1
Mrs.	1
Baynes,	1
too,	1
shrewdly	1
recognized	1
that	1
behind	1
the	1
uncompromising	1
frankness	1
of	1
June’s	1
manner	1
there	1
was	1
much	1
of	1
the	1
Forsyte.	1
If	1
the	1
girl	1
had	1
been	1
merely	1
frank	1
and	1
courageous,	1
Mrs.	1
Baynes	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
her	1
‘cranky,’	1
and	1
despised	1
her;	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
merely	1
a	1
Forsyte,	1
like	1
Francie	1
—	1
let	1
us	1
say	1
—	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
patronized	1
her	1
from	1
sheer	1
weight	1
of	1
metal;	1
but	1
June,	1
small	1
though	1
she	1
was	1
—	1
Mrs.	1
Baynes	1
habitually	1
admired	1
quantity	1
—	1
gave	1
her	1
an	1
uneasy	1
feeling;	1
and	1
she	1
placed	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
chair	1
opposite	1
the	1
light.	1
There	1
was	1
another	1
reason	1
for	1
her	1
respect	1
which	1
Mrs.	1
Baynes,	1
too	1
good	1
a	1
churchwoman	1
to	1
be	1
worldly,	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
last	1
to	1
admit	1
—	1
she	1
often	1
heard	1
her	1
husband	1
describe	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
as	1
extremely	1
well	1
off,	1
and	1
was	1
biassed	1
towards	1
his	1
granddaughter	1
for	1
the	1
soundest	1
of	1
all	1
reasons.	1
To-day	1
she	1
felt	1
the	1
emotion	1
with	1
which	1
we	1
read	1
a	1
novel	1
describing	1
a	1
hero	1
and	1
an	1
inheritance,	1
nervously	1
anxious	1
lest,	1
by	1
some	1
frightful	1
lapse	1
of	1
the	1
novelist,	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
should	1
be	1
left	1
without	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
end.	1
Her	1
manner	1
was	1
warm;	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
so	1
clearly	1
before	1
how	1
distinguished	1
and	1
desirable	1
a	1
girl	1
this	1
was.	1
She	1
asked	1
after	1
old	1
Jolyon’s	1
health.	1
A	1
wonderful	1
man	1
for	1
his	1
age;	1
so	1
upright,	1
and	1
young	1
looking,	1
and	1
how	1
old	1
was	1
he?	1
Eighty-one!	1
She	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
thought	1
it!	1
They	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
sea!	1
Very	1
nice	1
for	1
them;	1
she	1
supposed	1
June	1
heard	1
from	1
Phil	1
every	1
day?	1
Her	1
light	1
grey	1
eyes	1
became	1
more	1
prominent	1
as	1
she	1
asked	1
this	1
question;	1
but	1
the	1
girl	1
met	1
the	1
glance	1
without	1
flinching.	1
“No,”	1
she	1
said,	1
“he	1
never	1
writes!”	1
Mrs.	1
Baynes’s	1
eyes	1
dropped;	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
intention	1
of	1
doing	1
so,	1
but	1
they	1
did.	1
They	1
recovered	1
immediately.	1
“Of	1
course	1
not.	1
That’s	1
Phil	1
all	1
over	1
—	1
he	1
was	1
always	1
like	1
that!”	1
“Was	1
he?”	1
said	1
June.	1
The	1
brevity	1
of	1
the	1
answer	1
caused	1
Mrs.	1
Baynes’s	1
bright	1
smile	1
a	1
moment’s	1
hesitation;	1
she	1
disguised	1
it	1
by	1
a	1
quick	1
movement,	1
and	1
spreading	1
her	1
skirts	1
afresh,	1
said:	1
“Why,	1
my	1
dear	1
—	1
he’s	1
quite	1
the	1
most	1
harum-scarum	1
person;	1
one	1
never	1
pays	1
the	1
slightest	1
attention	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
does!”	1
The	1
conviction	1
came	1
suddenly	1
to	1
June	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
wasting	1
her	1
time;	1
even	1
were	1
she	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
question	1
point-blank,	1
she	1
would	1
never	1
get	1
anything	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
woman.	1
‘Do	1
you	1
see	1
him?’	1
she	1
asked,	1
her	1
face	1
crimsoning.	1
The	1
perspiration	1
broke	1
out	1
on	1
Mrs.	1
Baynes’	1
forehead	1
beneath	1
the	1
powder.	1
“Oh,	1
yes!	1
I	1
don’t	1
remember	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
here	1
last	1
—	1
indeed,	1
we	1
haven’t	1
seen	1
much	1
of	1
him	1
lately.	1
He’s	1
so	1
busy	1
with	1
your	1
cousin’s	1
house;	1
I’m	1
told	1
it’ll	1
be	1
finished	1
directly.	1
We	1
must	1
organize	1
a	1
little	1
dinner	1
to	1
celebrate	1
the	1
event;	1
do	1
come	1
and	1
stay	1
the	1
night	1
with	1
us!”	1
“Thank	1
you,”	1
said	1
June.	1
Again	1
she	1
thought:	1
‘I’m	1
only	1
wasting	1
my	1
time.	1
This	1
woman	1
will	1
tell	1
me	1
nothing.’	1
She	1
got	1
up	1
to	1
go.	1
A	1
change	1
came	1
over	1
Mrs.	1
Baynes.	1
She	1
rose	1
too;	1
her	1
lips	1
twitched,	1
she	1
fidgeted	1
her	1
hands.	1
Something	1
was	1
evidently	1
very	1
wrong,	1
and	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
dare	1
to	1
ask	1
this	1
girl,	1
who	1
stood	1
there,	1
a	1
slim,	1
straight	1
little	1
figure,	1
with	1
her	1
decided	1
face,	1
her	1
set	1
jaw,	1
and	1
resentful	1
eyes.	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
accustomed	1
to	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
asking	1
question’s	1
—	1
all	1
organization	1
was	1
based	1
on	1
the	1
asking	1
of	1
questions!	1
But	1
the	1
issue	1
was	1
so	1
grave	1
that	1
her	1
nerve,	1
normally	1
strong,	1
was	1
fairly	1
shaken;	1
only	1
that	1
morning	1
her	1
husband	1
had	1
said:	1
“Old	1
Mr.	1
Forsyte	1
must	1
be	1
worth	1
well	1
over	1
a	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
pounds!”	1
And	1
this	1
girl	1
stood	1
there,	1
holding	1
out	1
her	1
hand	1
—	1
holding	1
out	1
her	1
hand!	1
The	1
chance	1
might	1
be	1
slipping	1
away	1
—	1
she	1
couldn’t	1
tell	1
—	1
the	1
chance	1
of	1
keeping	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
family,	1
and	1
yet	1
she	1
dared	1
not	1
speak.	1
Her	1
eyes	1
followed	1
June	1
to	1
the	1
door.	1
It	1
closed.	1
Then	1
with	1
an	1
exclamation	1
Mrs.	1
Baynes	1
ran	1
forward,	1
wobbling	1
her	1
bulky	1
frame	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side,	1
and	1
opened	1
it	1
again.	1
Too	1
late!	1
She	1
heard	1
the	1
front	1
door	1
click,	1
and	1
stood	1
still,	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
real	1
anger	1
and	1
mortification	1
on	1
her	1
face.	1
June	1
went	1
along	1
the	1
Square	1
with	1
her	1
bird-like	1
quickness.	1
She	1
detested	1
that	1
woman	1
now	1
whom	1
in	1
happier	1
days	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
accustomed	1
to	1
think	1
so	1
kind.	1
Was	1
she	1
always	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
off	1
thus,	1
and	1
forced	1
to	1
undergo	1
this	1
torturing	1
suspense?	1
She	1
would	1
go	1
to	1
Phil	1
himself,	1
and	1
ask	1
him	1
what	1
he	1
meant.	1
She	1
had	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
know.	1
She	1
hurried	1
on	1
down	1
Sloane	1
Street	1
till	1
she	1
came	1
to	1
Bosinney’s	1
number.	1
Passing	1
the	1
swing-door	1
at	1
the	1
bottom,	1
she	1
ran	1
up	1
the	1
stairs,	1
her	1
heart	1
thumping	1
painfully.	1
At	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
flight	1
she	1
paused	1
for	1
breath,	1
and	1
holding	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
bannisters,	1
stood	1
listening.	1
No	1
sound	1
came	1
from	1
above.	1
With	1
a	1
very	1
white	1
face	1
she	1
mounted	1
the	1
last	1
flight.	1
She	1
saw	1
the	1
door,	1
with	1
his	1
name	1
on	1
the	1
plate.	1
And	1
the	1
resolution	1
that	1
had	1
brought	1
her	1
so	1
far	1
evaporated.	1
The	1
full	1
meaning	1
of	1
her	1
conduct	1
came	1
to	1
her.	1
She	1
felt	1
hot	1
all	1
over;	1
the	1
palms	1
of	1
her	1
hands	1
were	1
moist	1
beneath	1
the	1
thin	1
silk	1
covering	1
of	1
her	1
gloves.	1
She	1
drew	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
stairs,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
descend.	1
Leaning	1
against	1
the	1
rail	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
being	1
choked;	1
and	1
she	1
gazed	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
dreadful	1
courage.	1
No!	1
she	1
refused	1
to	1
go	1
down.	1
Did	1
it	1
matter	1
what	1
people	1
thought	1
of	1
her?	1
They	1
would	1
never	1
know!	1
No	1
one	1
would	1
help	1
her	1
if	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
help	1
herself!	1
She	1
would	1
go	1
through	1
with	1
it.	1
Forcing	1
herself,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
support	1
of	1
the	1
wall,	1
she	1
rang	1
the	1
bell.	1
The	1
door	1
did	1
not	1
open,	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
shame	1
and	1
fear	1
suddenly	1
abandoned	1
her;	1
she	1
rang	1
again	1
and	1
again,	1
as	1
though	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
its	1
emptiness	1
she	1
could	1
drag	1
some	1
response	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
closed	1
room,	1
some	1
recompense	1
for	1
the	1
shame	1
and	1
fear	1
that	1
visit	1
had	1
cost	1
her.	1
It	1
did	1
not	1
open;	1
she	1
left	1
off	1
ringing,	1
and,	1
sitting	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
stairs,	1
buried	1
her	1
face	1
in	1
her	1
hands.	1
Presently	1
she	1
stole	1
down,	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
air.	1
She	1
felt	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
passed	1
through	1
a	1
bad	1
illness,	1
and	1
had	1
no	1
desire	1
now	1
but	1
to	1
get	1
home	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
she	1
could.	1
The	1
people	1
she	1
met	1
seemed	1
to	1
know	1
where	1
she	1
had	1
been,	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
doing;	1
and	1
suddenly	1
—	1
over	1
on	1
the	1
opposite	1
side,	1
going	1
towards	1
his	1
rooms	1
from	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
Montpellier	1
Square	1
—	1
she	1
saw	1
Bosinney	1
himself.	1
She	1
made	1
a	1
movement	1
to	1
cross	1
into	1
the	1
traffic.	1
Their	1
eyes	1
met,	1
and	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
hat.	1
An	1
omnibus	1
passed,	1
obscuring	1
her	1
view;	1
then,	1
from	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
pavement,	1
through	1
a	1
gap	1
in	1
the	1
traffic,	1
she	1
saw	1
him	1
walking	1
on.	1
And	1
June	1
stood	1
motionless,	1
looking	1
after	1
him.	1
Chapter	1
22	1
Perfection	1
of	1
the	1
House	1
‘One	1
mockturtle,	1
clear;	1
one	1
oxtail;	1
two	1
glasses	1
of	1
port.’	1
In	1
the	1
upper	1
room	1
at	1
French’s,	1
where	1
a	1
Forsyte	1
could	1
still	1
get	1
heavy	1
English	1
food,	1
James	1
and	1
his	1
son	1
were	1
sitting	1
down	1
to	1
lunch.	1
Of	1
all	1
eating-places	1
James	1
liked	1
best	1
to	1
come	1
here;	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
unpretentious,	1
well-flavoured,	1
and	1
filling	1
about	1
it,	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
a	1
certain	1
extent	1
corrupted	1
by	1
the	1
necessity	1
for	1
being	1
fashionable,	1
and	1
the	1
trend	1
of	1
habits	1
keeping	1
pace	1
with	1
an	1
income	1
that	1
would	1
increase,	1
he	1
still	1
hankered	1
in	1
quiet	1
City	1
moments	1
after	1
the	1
tasty	1
fleshpots	1
of	1
his	1
earlier	1
days.	1
Here	1
you	1
were	1
served	1
by	1
hairy	1
English	1
waiters	1
in	1
aprons;	1
there	1
was	1
sawdust	1
on	1
the	1
floor,	1
and	1
three	1
round	1
gilt	1
looking-glasses	1
hung	1
just	1
above	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
sight.	1
They	1
had	1
only	1
recently	1
done	1
away	1
with	1
the	1
cubicles,	1
too,	1
in	1
which	1
you	1
could	1
have	1
your	1
chop,	1
prime	1
chump,	1
with	1
a	1
floury-potato,	1
without	1
seeing	1
your	1
neighbours,	1
like	1
a	1
gentleman.	1
He	1
tucked	1
the	1
top	1
corner	1
of	1
his	1
napkin	1
behind	1
the	1
third	1
button	1
of	1
his	1
waistcoat,	1
a	1
practice	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
obliged	1
to	1
abandon	1
years	1
ago	1
in	1
the	1
West	1
End.	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
relish	1
his	1
soup	1
—	1
the	1
entire	1
morning	1
had	1
been	1
given	1
to	1
winding	1
up	1
the	1
estate	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
friend.	1
After	1
filling	1
his	1
mouth	1
with	1
household	1
bread,	1
stale,	1
he	1
at	1
once	1
began:	1
“How	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
down	1
to	1
Robin	1
Hill?	1
You	1
going	1
to	1
take	1
Irene?	1
You’d	1
better	1
take	1
her.	1
I	1
should	1
think	1
there’ll	1
be	1
a	1
lot	1
that’ll	1
want	1
seeing	1
to.”	1
Without	1
looking	1
up,	1
Soames	1
answered:	1
“She	1
won’t	1
go.”	1
“Won’t	1
go?	1
What’s	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
that?	1
She’s	1
going	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
isn’t	1
she?”	1
Soames	1
made	1
no	1
reply.	1
“I	1
don’t	1
know	1
what’s	1
coming	1
to	1
women	1
nowadays,”	1
mumbled	1
James;	1
“I	1
never	1
used	1
to	1
have	1
any	1
trouble	1
with	1
them.	1
She’s	1
had	1
too	1
much	1
liberty.	1
She’s	1
spoiled.	1
.	3
”	1
Soames	1
lifted	1
his	1
eyes:	1
“I	1
won’t	1
have	1
anything	1
said	1
against	1
her,”	1
he	1
said	1
unexpectedly.	1
The	1
silence	1
was	1
only	1
broken	1
now	1
by	1
the	1
supping	1
of	1
James’s	1
soup.	1
The	1
waiter	1
brought	1
the	1
two	1
glasses	1
of	1
port,	1
but	1
Soames	1
stopped	1
him.	1
“That’s	1
not	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
serve	1
port,”	1
he	1
said;	1
“take	1
them	1
away,	1
and	1
bring	1
the	1
bottle.”	1
Rousing	1
himself	1
from	1
his	1
reverie	1
over	1
the	1
soup,	1
James	1
took	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
rapid	1
shifting	1
surveys	1
of	1
surrounding	1
facts.	1
“Your	1
mother’s	1
in	1
bed,”	1
he	1
said;	1
“you	1
can	1
have	1
the	1
carriage	1
to	1
take	1
you	1
down.	1
I	1
should	1
think	1
Irene’d	1
like	1
the	1
drive.	1
This	1
young	1
Bosinney’ll	1
be	1
there,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
to	1
show	1
you	1
over”	1
Soames	1
nodded.	1
“I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
for	1
myself	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
a	1
job	1
he’s	1
made	1
finishing	1
off,”	1
pursued	1
James.	1
“I’ll	1
just	1
drive	1
round	1
and	1
pick	1
you	1
both	1
up.”	1
“I	1
am	1
going	1
down	1
by	1
train,”	1
replied	1
Soames.	1
“If	1
you	1
like	1
to	1
drive	1
round	1
and	1
see,	1
Irene	1
might	1
go	1
with	1
you,	1
I	1
can’t	1
tell.”	1
He	1
signed	1
to	1
the	1
waiter	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
bill,	1
which	1
James	1
paid.	1
They	1
parted	1
at	1
St.	1
Paul’s,	1
Soames	1
branching	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
station,	1
James	1
taking	1
his	1
omnibus	1
westwards.	1
He	1
had	1
secured	1
the	1
corner	1
seat	1
next	1
the	1
conductor,	1
where	1
his	1
long	1
legs	1
made	1
it	1
difficult	1
for	1
anyone	1
to	1
get	1
in,	1
and	1
at	1
all	1
who	1
passed	1
him	1
he	1
looked	1
resentfully,	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
business	1
to	1
be	1
using	1
up	1
his	1
air.	1
He	1
intended	1
to	1
take	1
an	1
opportunity	1
this	1
afternoon	1
of	1
speaking	1
to	1
Irene.	1
A	1
word	1
in	1
time	1
saved	1
nine;	1
and	1
now	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
chance	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
turn	1
over	1
a	1
new	1
leaf!	1
He	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
Soames	1
wouldn’t	1
stand	1
very	1
much	1
more	1
of	1
her	1
goings	1
on!	1
It	1
did	1
not	1
occur	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
define	1
what	1
he	1
meant	1
by	1
her	1
‘goings	1
on’;	1
the	1
expression	1
was	1
wide,	1
vague,	1
and	1
suited	1
to	1
a	1
Forsyte.	1
And	1
James	1
had	1
more	1
than	1
his	1
common	1
share	1
of	1
courage	1
after	1
lunch.	1
On	1
reaching	1
home,	1
he	1
ordered	1
out	1
the	1
barouche,	1
with	1
special	1
instructions	1
that	1
the	1
groom	1
was	1
to	1
go	1
too.	1
He	1
wished	1
to	1
be	1
kind	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
every	1
chance.	1
When	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
No.62	1
was	1
opened	1
he	1
could	1
distinctly	1
hear	1
her	1
singing,	1
and	1
said	1
so	1
at	1
once,	1
to	1
prevent	1
any	1
chance	1
of	1
being	1
denied	1
entrance.	1
Yes,	1
Mrs.	1
Soames	1
was	1
in,	1
but	1
the	1
maid	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
if	1
she	1
was	1
seeing	1
people.	1
James,	1
moving	1
with	1
the	1
rapidity	1
that	1
ever	1
astonished	1
the	1
observers	1
of	1
his	1
long	1
figure	1
and	1
absorbed	1
expression,	1
went	1
forthwith	1
into	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
without	1
permitting	1
this	1
to	1
be	1
ascertained.	1
He	1
found	1
Irene	1
seated	1
at	1
the	1
piano	1
with	1
her	1
hands	1
arrested	1
on	1
the	1
keys,	1
evidently	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
voices	1
in	1
the	1
hall.	1
She	1
greeted	1
him	1
without	1
smiling.	1
“Your	1
mother-in-law’s	1
in	1
bed,”	1
he	1
began,	1
hoping	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
enlist	1
her	1
sympathy.	1
“I’ve	1
got	1
the	1
carriage	1
here.	1
Now,	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
girl,	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
your	1
hat	1
and	1
come	1
with	1
me	1
for	1
a	1
drive.	1
It’ll	1
do	1
you	1
good!”	1
Irene	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
as	1
though	1
about	1
to	1
refuse,	1
but,	1
seeming	1
to	1
change	1
her	1
mind,	1
went	1
upstairs,	1
and	1
came	1
down	1
again	1
with	1
her	1
hat	1
on.	1
“Where	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
take	1
me?”	1
she	1
asked.	1
“We’ll	1
just	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
Robin	1
Hill,”	1
said	1
James,	1
spluttering	1
out	1
his	1
words	1
very	1
quick;	1
“the	1
horses	1
want	1
exercise,	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
they’ve	1
been	1
doing	1
down	1
there.”	1
Irene	1
hung	1
back,	1
but	1
again	1
changed	1
her	1
mind,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
carriage,	1
James	1
brooding	1
over	1
her	1
closely,	1
to	1
make	1
quite	1
sure.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
her	1
more	1
than	1
half	1
way	1
that	1
he	1
began:	1
“Soames	1
is	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
you	1
—	1
he	1
won’t	1
have	1
anything	1
said	1
against	1
you;	1
why	1
don’t	1
you	1
show	1
him	1
more	1
affection?”	1
Irene	1
flushed,	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice:	1
“I	1
can’t	1
show	1
what	1
I	1
haven’t	1
got.”	1
James	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
sharply;	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
now	1
he	1
had	1
her	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
carriage,	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
horses	1
and	1
servants,	1
he	1
was	1
really	1
in	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
situation.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
put	1
him	1
off;	1
nor	1
would	1
she	1
make	1
a	1
scene	1
in	1
public.	1
“I	1
can’t	1
think	1
what	1
you’re	1
about,”	1
he	1
said.	1
“He’s	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
husband!”	1
Irene’s	1
answer	1
was	1
so	1
low	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
almost	1
inaudible	1
among	1
the	1
sounds	1
of	1
traffic.	1
He	1
caught	1
the	1
words:	1
“You	1
are	1
not	1
married	1
to	1
him!”	1
“What’s	1
that	1
got	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
it?	1
He’s	1
given	1
you	1
everything	1
you	1
want.	1
He’s	1
always	1
ready	1
to	1
take	1
you	1
anywhere,	1
and	1
now	1
he’s	1
built	1
you	1
this	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
country.	1
It’s	1
not	1
as	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
anything	1
of	1
your	1
own.”	1
“No.”	1
Again	1
James	1
looked	1
at	1
her;	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
out	1
the	1
expression	1
on	1
her	1
face.	1
She	1
looked	1
almost	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
going	1
to	1
cry,	1
and	1
yet.	1
.	3
“I’m	1
sure,”	1
he	1
muttered	1
hastily,	1
“we’ve	1
all	1
tried	1
to	1
be	1
kind	1
to	1
you.”	1
Irene’s	1
lips	1
quivered;	1
to	1
his	1
dismay	1
James	1
saw	1
a	1
tear	1
steal	1
down	1
her	1
cheek.	1
He	1
felt	1
a	1
choke	1
rise	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
throat.	1
“We’re	1
all	1
fond	1
of	1
you,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“if	1
you’d	1
only”—	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
say,	1
“behave	1
yourself,”	1
but	1
changed	1
it	1
to	1
—“if	1
you’d	1
only	1
be	1
more	1
of	1
a	1
wife	1
to	1
him.”	1
Irene	1
did	1
not	1
answer,	1
and	1
James,	1
too,	1
ceased	1
speaking.	1
There	1
was	1
something	1
in	1
her	1
silence	1
which	1
disconcerted	1
him;	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
silence	1
of	1
obstinacy,	1
rather	1
that	1
of	1
acquiescence	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
find	1
to	1
say.	1
And	1
yet	1
he	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
had	1
the	1
last	1
word.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
this.	1
He	1
was	1
unable,	1
however,	1
to	1
long	1
keep	1
silence.	1
“I	1
suppose	1
that	1
young	1
Bosinney,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“will	1
be	1
getting	1
married	1
to	1
June	1
now?”	1
Irene’s	1
face	1
changed.	1
“I	1
don’t	1
know,”	1
she	1
said;	1
“you	1
should	1
ask	1
her.”	1
“Does	1
she	1
write	1
to	1
you?”	1
No.	1
“How’s	1
that?”	1
said	1
James.	1
“I	1
thought	1
you	1
and	1
she	1
were	1
such	1
great	1
friends.”	1
Irene	1
turned	1
on	1
him.	1
“Again,”	1
she	1
said,	1
“you	1
should	1
ask	1
her!”	1
“Well,”	1
flustered	1
James,	1
frightened	1
by	1
her	1
look,	1
“it’s	1
very	1
odd	1
that	1
I	1
can’t	1
get	1
a	1
plain	1
answer	1
to	1
a	1
plain	1
question,	1
but	1
there	1
it	1
is.”	1
He	1
sat	1
ruminating	1
over	1
his	1
rebuff,	1
and	1
burst	1
out	1
at	1
last:	1
“Well,	1
I’ve	1
warned	1
you.	1
You	1
won’t	1
look	1
ahead.	1
Soames	1
he	1
doesn’t	1
say	1
much,	1
but	1
I	1
can	1
see	1
he	1
won’t	1
stand	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
more	1
of	1
this	1
sort	1
of	1
thing.	1
You’ll	1
have	1
nobody	1
but	1
yourself	1
to	1
blame,	1
and,	1
what’s	1
more,	1
you’ll	1
get	1
no	1
sympathy	1
from	1
anybody.”	1
Irene	1
bent	1
her	1
head	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
smiling	1
bow.	1
“I	1
am	1
very	1
much	1
obliged	1
to	1
you.”	1
James	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
on	1
earth	1
to	1
answer.	1
The	1
bright	1
hot	1
morning	1
had	1
changed	1
slowly	1
to	1
a	1
grey,	1
oppressive	1
afternoon;	1
a	1
heavy	1
bank	1
of	1
clouds,	1
with	1
the	1
yellow	1
tinge	1
of	1
coming	1
thunder,	1
had	1
risen	1
in	1
the	1
south,	1
and	1
was	1
creeping	1
up.	1
The	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
trees	1
dropped	1
motionless	1
across	1
the	1
road	1
without	1
the	1
smallest	1
stir	1
of	1
foliage.	1
A	1
faint	1
odour	1
of	1
glue	1
from	1
the	1
heated	1
horses	1
clung	1
in	1
the	1
thick	1
air;	1
the	1
coachman	1
and	1
groom,	1
rigid	1
and	1
unbending,	1
exchanged	1
stealthy	1
murmurs	1
on	1
the	1
box,	1
without	1
ever	1
turning	1
their	1
heads.	1
To	1
James’	1
great	1
relief	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
house	1
at	1
last;	1
the	1
silence	1
and	1
impenetrability	1
of	1
this	1
woman	1
by	1
his	1
side,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
thought	1
so	1
soft	1
and	1
mild,	1
alarmed	1
him.	1
The	1
carriage	1
put	1
them	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
they	1
entered.	1
The	1
hall	1
was	1
cool,	1
and	1
so	1
still	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
like	1
passing	1
into	1
a	1
tomb;	1
a	1
shudder	1
ran	1
down	1
James’s	1
spine.	1
He	1
quickly	1
lifted	1
the	1
heavy	1
leather	1
curtains	1
between	1
the	1
columns	1
into	1
the	1
inner	1
court.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
restrain	1
an	1
exclamation	1
of	1
approval.	1
The	1
decoration	1
was	1
really	1
in	1
excellent	1
taste.	1
The	1
dull	1
ruby	1
tiles	1
that	1
extended	1
from	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
walls	1
to	1
the	1
verge	1
of	1
a	1
circular	1
clump	1
of	1
tall	1
iris	1
plants,	1
surrounding	1
in	1
turn	1
a	1
sunken	1
basin	1
of	1
white	1
marble	1
filled	1
with	1
water,	1
were	1
obviously	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
quality.	1
He	1
admired	1
extremely	1
the	1
purple	1
leather	1
curtains	1
drawn	1
along	1
one	1
entire	1
side,	1
framing	1
a	1
huge	1
white-tiled	1
stove.	1
The	1
central	1
partitions	1
of	1
the	1
skylight	1
had	1
been	1
slid	1
back,	1
and	1
the	1
warm	1
air	1
from	1
outside	1
penetrated	1
into	1
the	1
very	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
house.	1
He	1
stood,	1
his	1
hands	1
behind	1
him,	1
his	1
head	1
bent	1
back	1
on	1
his	1
high,	1
narrow	1
shoulders,	1
spying	1
the	1
tracery	1
on	1
the	1
columns	1
and	1
the	1
pattern	1
of	1
the	1
frieze	1
which	1
ran	1
round	1
the	1
ivory-coloured	1
walls	1
under	1
the	1
gallery.	1
Evidently,	1
no	1
pains	1
had	1
been	1
spared.	1
It	1
was	1
quite	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
a	1
gentleman.	1
He	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
curtains,	1
and,	1
having	1
discovered	1
how	1
they	1
were	1
worked,	1
drew	1
them	1
asunder	1
and	1
disclosed	1
the	1
picture-gallery,	1
ending	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
window	1
taking	1
up	1
the	1
whole	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
It	1
had	1
a	1
black	1
oak	1
floor,	1
and	1
its	1
walls,	1
again,	1
were	1
of	1
ivory	1
white.	1
He	1
went	1
on	1
throwing	1
open	1
doors,	1
and	1
peeping	1
in.	1
Everything	1
was	1
in	1
apple-pie	1
order,	1
ready	1
for	1
immediate	1
occupation.	1
He	1
turned	1
round	1
at	1
last	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
Irene,	1
and	1
saw	1
her	1
standing	1
over	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
entrance,	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
Bosinney.	1
Though	1
not	1
remarkable	1
for	1
sensibility,	1
James	1
felt	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
something	1
was	1
wrong.	1
He	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
them,	1
and,	1
vaguely	1
alarmed,	1
ignorant	1
of	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
trouble,	1
made	1
an	1
attempt	1
to	1
smooth	1
things	1
over.	1
“How	1
are	1
you,	1
Mr.	1
Bosinney?”	1
he	1
said,	1
holding	1
out	1
his	1
hand.	1
“You’ve	1
been	1
spending	1
money	1
pretty	1
freely	1
down	1
here,	1
I	1
should	1
say!”	1
Soames	1
turned	1
his	1
back,	1
and	1
walked	1
away.	1
James	1
looked	1
from	1
Bosinney’s	1
frowning	1
face	1
to	1
Irene,	1
and,	1
in	1
his	1
agitation,	1
spoke	1
his	1
thoughts	1
aloud:	1
“Well,	1
I	1
can’t	1
tell	1
what’s	1
the	1
matter.	1
Nobody	1
tells	1
me	1
anything!”	1
And,	1
making	1
off	1
after	1
his	1
son,	1
he	1
heard	1
Bosinney’s	1
short	1
laugh,	1
and	1
his	1
“Well,	1
thank	1
God!	1
You	1
look	1
so.	1
.	3
”	1
Most	1
unfortunately	1
he	1
lost	1
the	1
rest.	1
What	1
had	1
happened?	1
He	1
glanced	1
back.	1
Irene	1
was	1
very	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
architect,	1
and	1
her	1
face	1
not	1
like	1
the	1
face	1
he	1
knew	1
of	1
her.	1
He	1
hastened	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
son.	1
Soames	1
was	1
pacing	1
the	1
picture-gallery.	1
“What’s	1
the	1
matter?”	1
said	1
James.	1
“What’s	1
all	1
this?”	1
Soames	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
supercilious	1
calm	1
unbroken,	1
but	1
James	1
knew	1
well	1
enough	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
violently	1
angry.	1
“Our	1
friend,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“has	1
exceeded	1
his	1
instructions	1
again,	1
that’s	1
all.	1
So	1
much	1
the	1
worse	1
for	1
him	1
this	1
time.”	1
He	1
turned	1
round	1
and	1
walked	1
back	1
towards	1
the	1
door.	1
James	1
followed	1
hurriedly,	1
edging	1
himself	1
in	1
front.	1
He	1
saw	1
Irene	1
take	1
her	1
finger	1
from	1
before	1
her	1
lips,	1
heard	1
her	1
say	1
something	1
in	1
her	1
ordinary	1
voice,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
before	1
he	1
reached	1
them.	1
“There’s	1
a	1
storm	1
coming	1
on.	1
We’d	1
better	1
get	1
home.	1
We	1
can’t	1
take	1
you,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
Mr.	1
Bosinney?	1
No,	1
I	1
suppose	1
not.	1
Then,	1
good-bye!”	1
He	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
hand.	1
Bosinney	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
it,	1
but,	1
turning	1
with	1
a	1
laugh,	1
said:	1
“Good-bye,	1
Mr.	1
Forsyte.	1
Don’t	1
get	1
caught	1
in	1
the	1
storm!”	1
and	1
walked	1
away.	1
“Well,”	1
began	1
James,	1
“I	1
don’t	1
know.	1
.	3
”	1
But	1
the	1
‘sight	1
of	1
Irene’s	1
face	1
stopped	1
him.	1
Taking	1
hold	1
of	1
his	1
daughter-in-law	1
by	1
the	1
elbow,	1
he	1
escorted	1
her	1
towards	1
the	1
carriage.	1
He	1
felt	1
certain,	1
quite	1
certain,	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
making	1
some	1
appointment	1
or	1
other.	1
.	3
Nothing	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
is	1
more	1
sure	1
to	1
upset	1
a	1
Forsyte	1
than	1
the	1
discovery	1
that	1
something	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
stipulated	1
to	1
spend	1
a	1
certain	1
sum	1
has	1
cost	1
more.	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
reasonable,	1
for	1
upon	1
the	1
accuracy	1
of	1
his	1
estimates	1
the	1
whole	1
policy	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
is	1
ordered.	1
If	1
he	1
cannot	1
rely	1
on	1
definite	1
values	1
of	1
property,	1
his	1
compass	1
is	1
amiss;	1
he	1
is	1
adrift	1
upon	1
bitter	1
waters	1
without	1
a	1
helm.	1
After	1
writing	1
to	1
Bosinney	1
in	1
the	1
terms	1
that	1
have	1
already	1
been	1
chronicled,	1
Soames	1
had	1
dismissed	1
the	1
cost	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
from	1
his	1
mind.	1
He	1
believed	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
the	1
matter	1
of	1
the	1
final	1
cost	1
so	1
very	1
plain	1
that	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
again	1
exceeded	1
had	1
really	1
never	1
entered	1
his	1
head.	1
On	1
hearing	1
from	1
Bosinney	1
that	1
his	1
limit	1
of	1
twelve	1
thousand	1
pounds	1
would	1
be	1
exceeded	1
by	1
something	1
like	1
four	1
hundred,	1
he	1
had	1
grown	1
white	1
with	1
anger.	1
His	1
original	1
estimate	1
of	1
the	1
cost	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
completed	1
had	1
been	1
ten	1
thousand	1
pounds,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
often	1
blamed	1
himself	1
severely	1
for	1
allowing	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
led	1
into	1
repeated	1
excesses.	1
Over	1
this	1
last	1
expenditure,	1
however,	1
Bosinney	1
had	1
put	1
himself	1
completely	1
in	1
the	1
wrong.	1
How	1
on	1
earth	1
a	1
fellow	1
could	1
make	1
such	1
an	1
ass	1
of	1
himself	1
Soames	1
could	1
not	1
conceive;	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
so,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
rancour	1
and	1
hidden	1
jealousy	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
burning	1
against	1
him	1
for	1
so	1
long	1
was	1
now	1
focussed	1
in	1
rage	1
at	1
this	1
crowning	1
piece	1
of	1
extravagance.	1
The	1
attitude	1
of	1
the	1
confident	1
and	1
friendly	1
husband	1
was	1
gone.	1
To	1
preserve	1
property	1
—	1
his	1
wife	1
—	1
he	1
had	1
assumed	1
it,	1
to	1
preserve	1
property	1
of	1
another	1
kind	1
he	1
lost	1
it	1
now.	1
“Ah!”	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
to	1
Bosinney	1
when	1
he	1
could	1
speak,	1
“and	1
I	1
suppose	1
you’re	1
perfectly	1
contented	1
with	1
yourself.	1
But	1
I	1
may	1
as	1
well	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
you’ve	1
altogether	1
mistaken	1
your	1
man!”	1
What	1
he	1
meant	1
by	1
those	1
words	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
quite	1
know	1
at	1
the	1
time,	1
but	1
after	1
dinner	1
he	1
looked	1
up	1
the	1
correspondence	1
between	1
himself	1
and	1
Bosinney	1
to	1
make	1
quite	1
sure.	1
There	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
two	1
opinions	1
about	1
it	1
—	1
the	1
fellow	1
had	1
made	1
himself	1
liable	1
for	1
that	1
extra	1
four	1
hundred,	1
or,	1
at	1
all	1
events,	1
for	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
good.	1
He	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
wife’s	1
face	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
this	1
conclusion.	1
Seated	1
in	1
her	1
usual	1
seat	1
on	1
the	1
sofa,	1
she	1
was	1
altering	1
the	1
lace	1
on	1
a	1
collar.	1
She	1
had	1
not	1
once	1
spoken	1
to	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
evening.	1
He	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
mantelpiece,	1
and	1
contemplating	1
his	1
face	1
in	1
the	1
mirror	1
said:	1
“Your	1
friend	1
the	1
Buccaneer	1
has	1
made	1
a	1
fool	1
of	1
himself;	1
he	1
will	1
have	1
to	1
pay	1
for	1
it!”	1
She	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
scornfully,	1
and	1
answered:	1
“I	1
don’t	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
talking	1
about!”	1
“You	1
soon	1
will.	1
A	1
mere	1
trifle,	1
quite	1
beneath	1
your	1
contempt	1
—	1
four	1
hundred	1
pounds.”	1
“Do	1
you	1
mean	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
pay	1
that	1
towards	1
this	1
hateful,	1
house?”	1
“I	1
do.”	1
“And	1
you	1
know	1
he’s	1
got	1
nothing?”	1
“Yes.”	1
“Then	1
you	1
are	1
meaner	1
than	1
I	1
thought	1
you.”	1
Soames	1
turned	1
from	1
the	1
mirror,	1
and	1
unconsciously	1
taking	1
a	1
china	1
cup	1
from	1
the	1
mantelpiece,	1
clasped	1
his	1
hands	1
around	1
it	1
as	1
though	1
praying.	1
He	1
saw	1
her	1
bosom	1
rise	1
and	1
fall,	1
her	1
eyes	1
darkening	1
with	1
anger,	1
and	1
taking	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
the	1
taunt,	1
he	1
asked	1
quietly:	1
“Are	1
you	1
carrying	1
on	1
a	1
flirtation	1
with	1
Bosinney?”	1
“No,	1
I	1
am	1
not!”	1
Her	1
eyes	1
met	1
his,	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
away.	1
He	1
neither	1
believed	1
nor	1
disbelieved	1
her,	1
but	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
mistake	1
in	1
asking;	1
he	1
never	1
had	1
known,	1
never	1
would	1
know,	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
thinking.	1
The	1
sight	1
of	1
her	1
inscrutable	1
face,	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
hundreds	1
of	1
evenings	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
her	1
sitting	1
there	1
like	1
that	1
soft	1
and	1
passive,	1
but	1
unreadable,	1
unknown,	1
enraged	1
him	1
beyond	1
measure.	1
“I	1
believe	1
you	1
are	1
made	1
of	1
stone,”	1
he	1
said,	1
clenching	1
his	1
fingers	1
so	1
hard	1
that	1
he	1
broke	1
the	1
fragile	1
cup.	1
The	1
pieces	1
fell	1
into	1
the	1
grate.	1
And	1
Irene	1
smiled.	1
“You	1
seem	1
to	1
forget,”	1
she	1
said,	1
“that	1
cup	1
is	1
not!”	1
Soames	1
gripped	1
her	1
arm.	1
“A	1
good	1
beating,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“is	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
that	1
would	1
bring	1
you	1
to	1
your	1
senses,”	1
but	1
turning	1
on	1
his	1
heel,	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
Chapter	1
23	1
Soames	1
Sits	1
on	1
the	1
Stairs	1
Soames	1
went	1
upstairs	1
that	1
night	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
too	1
far.	1
He	1
was	1
prepared	1
to	1
offer	1
excuses	1
for	1
his	1
words.	1
He	1
turned	1
out	1
the	1
gas	1
still	1
burning	1
in	1
the	1
passage	1
outside	1
their	1
room.	1
Pausing,	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
on	1
the	1
knob	1
of	1
the	1
door,	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
shape	1
his	1
apology,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
intention	1
of	1
letting	1
her	1
see	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
nervous.	1
But	1
the	1
door	1
did	1
not	1
open,	1
nor	1
when	1
he	1
pulled	1
it	1
and	1
turned	1
the	1
handle	1
firmly.	1
She	1
must	1
have	1
locked	1
it	1
for	1
some	1
reason,	1
and	1
forgotten.	1
Entering	1
his	1
dressing-room	1
where	1
the	1
gas	1
was	1
also	1
light	1
and	1
burning	1
low,	1
he	1
went	1
quickly	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
door.	1
That	1
too	1
was	1
locked.	1
Then	1
he	1
noticed	1
that	1
the	1
camp	1
bed	1
which	1
he	1
occasionally	1
used	1
was	1
prepared,	1
and	1
his	1
sleeping-suit	1
laid	1
out	1
upon	1
it.	1
He	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
forehead,	1
and	1
brought	1
it	1
away	1
wet.	1
It	1
dawned	1
on	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
barred	1
out.	1
He	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
rattling	1
the	1
handle	1
stealthily,	1
called:	1
“Unlock	1
the	1
door,	1
do	1
you	1
hear?	1
Unlock	1
the	1
door!”	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
faint	1
rustling,	1
but	1
no	1
answer.	1
“Do	1
you	1
hear?	1
Let	1
me	1
in	1
at	1
once	1
—	1
I	1
insist	1
on	1
being	1
let	1
in!”	1
He	1
could	1
catch	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
her	1
breathing	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
door,	1
like	1
the	1
breathing	1
of	1
a	1
creature	1
threatened	1
by	1
danger.	1
There	1
was	1
something	1
terrifying	1
in	1
this	1
inexorable	1
silence,	1
in	1
the	1
impossibility	1
of	1
getting	1
at	1
her.	1
He	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
door,	1
and	1
putting	1
his	1
whole	1
weight	1
against	1
it,	1
tried	1
to	1
burst	1
it	1
open.	1
The	1
door	1
was	1
a	1
new	1
one	1
—	1
he	1
had	2
them	1
renewed	1
himself,	1
in	1
readiness	1
for	1
their	1
coming	1
in	1
after	1
the	1
honeymoon.	1
In	1
a	1
rage	1
he	1
lifted	1
his	1
foot	1
to	1
kick	1
in	1
the	1
panel;	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
restrained	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
suddenly	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
beaten.	1
Flinging	1
himself	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
dressing-room,	1
he	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
book.	1
But	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
print	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
wife	1
—	1
with	1
her	1
yellow	1
hair	1
flowing	1
over	1
her	1
bare	1
shoulders,	1
and	1
her	1
great	1
dark	1
eyes	1
—	1
standing	1
like	1
an	1
animal	1
at	1
bay.	1
And	1
the	1
whole	1
meaning	1
of	1
her	1
act	1
of	1
revolt	1
came	1
to	1
him.	1
She	1
meant	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
for	1
good.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
sit	1
still,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
again.	1
He	1
could	1
still	1
hear	1
her,	1
and	1
he	1
called:	1
“Irene!	1
Irene!”	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
mean	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
voice	1
pathetic.	1
In	1
ominous	1
answer,	1
the	1
faint	1
sounds	1
ceased.	1
He	1
stood	1
with	1
clenched	1
hands,	1
thinking.	1
Presently	1
he	1
stole	1
round	1
on	1
tiptoe,	1
and	1
running	1
suddenly	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
door,	1
made	1
a	1
supreme	1
effort	1
to	1
break	1
it	1
open.	1
It	1
creaked,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
yield.	1
He	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
stairs	1
and	1
buried	1
his	1
face	1
in	1
his	1
hands.	1
For	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
he	1
sat	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
dark,	1
the	1
moon	1
through	1
the	1
skylight	1
above	1
laying	1
a	1
pale	1
smear	1
which	1
lengthened	1
slowly	1
towards	1
him	1
down	1
the	1
stairway.	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
be	1
philosophical.	1
Since	1
she	1
had	1
locked	1
her	1
doors	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
further	1
claim	1
as	1
a	1
wife,	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
console	1
himself	1
with	1
other	1
women.	1
It	1
was	1
but	1
a	1
spectral	1
journey	1
he	1
made	1
among	1
such	1
delights	1
—	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
appetite	1
for	1
these	1
exploits.	1
He	1
had	1
never	1
had	1
much,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
lost	1
the	1
habit.	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
never	1
recover	1
it.	1
His	1
hunger	1
could	1
only	1
be	1
appeased	1
by	1
his	1
wife,	1
inexorable	1
and	1
frightened,	1
behind	1
these	1
shut	1
doors.	1
No	1
other	1
woman	1
could	1
help	1
him.	1
This	1
conviction	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
terrible	1
force	1
out	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
dark.	1
His	1
philosophy	1
left	1
him;	1
and	1
surly	1
anger	1
took	1
its	1
place.	1
Her	1
conduct	1
was	1
immoral,	1
inexcusable,	1
worthy	1
of	1
any	1
punishment	1
within	1
his	1
power.	1
He	1
desired	1
no	1
one	1
but	1
her,	1
and	1
she	1
refused	1
him!	1
She	1
must	1
really	1
hate	1
him,	1
then!	1
He	1
had	1
never	1
believed	1
it	1
yet.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
it	1
now.	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
incredible.	1
He	1
felt	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
lost	1
for	1
ever	1
his	1
power	1
of	1
judgment.	1
If	1
she,	1
so	1
soft	1
and	1
yielding	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
judged	1
her,	1
could	1
take	1
this	1
decided	1
step	1
—	1
what	1
could	1
not	1
happen?	1
Then	1
he	1
asked	1
himself	1
again	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
carrying	1
on	1
an	1
intrigue	1
with	1
Bosinney.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
that	1
she	1
was;	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
afford	1
to	1
believe	1
such	1
a	1
reason	1
for	1
her	1
conduct	1
—	1
the	1
thought	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
faced.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
unbearable	1
to	1
contemplate	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
making	1
his	1
marital	1
relations	1
public	1
property.	1
Short	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
convincing	1
proofs	1
he	1
must	1
still	1
refuse	1
to	1
believe,	1
for	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
punish	1
himself.	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
at	1
heart	1
—	1
he	1
did	1
believe.	1
The	1
moonlight	1
cast	1
a	1
greyish	1
tinge	1
over	1
his	1
figure,	1
hunched	1
against	1
the	1
staircase	1
wall.	1
Bosinney	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her!	1
He	1
hated	1
the	1
fellow,	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
spare	1
him	1
now.	1
He	1
could	1
and	1
would	1
refuse	1
to	1
pay	1
a	1
penny	1
piece	1
over	1
twelve	1
thousand	1
and	1
fifty	1
pounds	1
—	1
the	1
extreme	1
limit	1
fixed	1
in	1
the	1
correspondence;	1
or	1
rather	1
he	1
would	1
pay,	1
he	1
would	1
pay	1
and	1
sue	1
him	1
for	1
damages.	1
He	1
would	1
go	1
to	1
Jobling	1
and	1
Boulter	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
matter	1
in	1
their	1
hands.	1
He	1
would	1
ruin	1
the	1
impecunious	1
beggar!	1
And	1
suddenly	1
—	1
though	1
what	1
connection	1
between	1
the	1
thoughts?	1
—	1
he	1
reflected	1
that	1
Irene	1
had	1
no	1
money	1
either.	1
They	1
were	1
both	1
beggars.	1
This	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
strange	1
satisfaction.	1
The	1
silence	1
was	1
broken	1
by	1
a	1
faint	1
creaking	1
through	1
the	1
wall.	1
She	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
bed	1
at	1
last.	1
Ah!	1
Joy	1
and	1
pleasant	1
dreams!	1
If	1
she	1
threw	1
the	1
door	1
open	1
wide	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
go	1
in	1
now!	1
But	1
his	1
lips,	1
that	1
were	1
twisted	1
in	1
a	1
bitter	1
smile,	1
twitched;	1
he	1
covered	1
his	1
eyes	1
with	1
his	1
hands.	1
.	3
It	1
was	1
late	1
the	1
following	1
afternoon	1
when	1
Soames	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
dining-room	1
window	1
gazing	1
gloomily	1
into	1
the	1
Square.	1
The	1
sunlight	1
still	1
showered	1
on	1
the	1
plane-trees,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
breeze	1
their	1
gay	1
broad	1
leaves	1
shone	1
and	1
swung	1
in	1
rhyme	1
to	1
a	1
barrel	1
organ	1
at	1
the	1
corner.	1
It	1
was	1
playing	1
a	1
waltz,	1
an	1
old	1
waltz	1
that	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
fashion,	1
with	1
a	1
fateful	1
rhythm	1
in	1
the	1
notes;	1
and	1
it	1
went	1
on	1
and	1
on,	1
though	1
nothing	1
indeed	1
but	1
leaves	1
danced	1
to	1
the	1
tune.	1
The	1
woman	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
too	1
gay,	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
tired;	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
tall	1
houses	1
no	1
one	1
threw	1
her	1
down	1
coppers.	1
She	1
moved	1
the	1
organ	1
on,	1
and	1
three	1
doors	1
off	1
began	1
again.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
waltz	1
they	1
had	1
played	1
at	1
Roger’s	1
when	1
Irene	1
had	1
danced	1
with	1
Bosinney;	1
and	1
the	1
perfume	1
of	1
the	1
gardenias	1
she	1
had	1
worn	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
Soames,	1
drifted	1
by	1
the	1
malicious	1
music,	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
drifted	1
to	1
him	1
then,	1
when	1
she	1
passed,	1
her	1
hair	1
glistening,	1
her	1
eyes	1
so	1
soft,	1
drawing	1
Bosinney	1
on	1
and	1
on	1
down	1
an	1
endless	1
ballroom.	1
The	1
organ	1
woman	1
plied	1
her	1
handle	1
slowly;	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
grinding	1
her	1
tune	1
all	1
day-grinding	1
it	1
in	1
Sloane	1
Street	1
hard	1
by,	1
grinding	1
it	1
perhaps	1
to	1
Bosinney	1
himself.	1
Soames	1
turned,	1
took	1
a	1
cigarette	1
from	1
the	1
carven	1
box,	1
and	1
walked	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
window.	1
The	1
tune	1
had	1
mesmerized	1
him,	1
and	1
there	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
view	1
Irene,	1
her	1
sunshade	1
furled,	1
hastening	1
homewards	1
down	1
the	1
Square,	1
in	1
a	1
soft,	1
rose-coloured	1
blouse	1
with	1
drooping	1
sleeves,	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know.	1
She	1
stopped	1
before	1
the	1
organ,	1
took	1
out	1
her	1
purse,	1
and	1
gave	1
the	1
woman	1
money.	1
Soames	1
shrank	1
back	1
and	1
stood	1
where	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
into	1
the	1
hall.	1
She	1
came	1
in	1
with	1
her	1
latch-key,	1
put	1
down	1
her	1
sunshade,	1
and	1
stood	1
looking	1
at	1
herself	1
in	1
the	1
glass.	1
Her	1
cheeks	1
were	1
flushed	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
sun	1
had	1
burned	1
them;	1
her	1
lips	1
were	1
parted	1
in	1
a	1
smile.	1
She	1
stretched	1
her	1
arms	1
out	1
as	1
though	1
to	1
embrace	1
herself,	1
with	1
a	1
laugh	1
that	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
sob.	1
Soames	1
stepped	1
forward.	1
“Very-pretty!”	1
he	1
said.	1
But	1
as	1
though	1
shot	1
she	1
spun	1
round,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
passed	1
him	1
up	1
the	1
stairs.	1
He	1
barred	1
the	1
way.	1
“Why	1
such	1
a	1
hurry?”	1
he	1
said,	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
fastened	1
on	1
a	1
curl	1
of	1
hair	1
fallen	1
loose	1
across	1
her	1
ear.	1
.	3
He	1
hardly	1
recognised	1
her.	1
She	1
seemed	1
on	1
fire,	1
so	1
deep	1
and	1
rich	1
the	1
colour	1
of	1
her	1
cheeks,	1
her	1
eyes,	1
her	1
lips,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
unusual	1
blouse	1
she	1
wore.	1
She	1
put	1
up	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
smoothed	1
back	1
the	1
curl.	1
She	1
was	1
breathing	1
fast	1
and	1
deep,	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
running,	1
and	1
with	1
every	1
breath	1
perfume	1
seemed	1
to	1
come	1
from	1
her	1
hair,	1
and	1
from	1
her	1
body,	1
like	1
perfume	1
from	1
an	1
opening	1
flower.	1
“I	1
don’t	1
like	1
that	1
blouse,”	1
he	1
said	1
slowly,	1
“it’s	1
a	1
soft,	1
shapeless	1
thing!”	1
He	1
lifted	1
his	1
finger	1
towards	1
her	1
breast,	1
but	1
she	1
dashed	1
his	1
hand	1
aside.	1
“Don’t	1
touch	1
me!”	1
she	1
cried.	1
He	1
caught	1
her	1
wrist;	1
she	1
wrenched	1
it	1
away.	1
“And	1
where	1
may	1
you	1
have	1
been?”	1
he	1
asked.	1
“In	1
heaven	1
—	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
house!”	1
With	1
those	1
words	1
she	1
fled	1
upstairs.	1
Outside	1
—	1
in	1
thanksgiving	1
—	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
door,	1
the	1
organ-grinder	1
was	1
playing	1
the	1
waltz.	1
And	1
Soames	1
stood	1
motionless.	1
What	1
prevented	1
him	1
from	1
following	1
her?	1
Was	1
it	1
that,	1
with	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
faith,	1
he	1
saw	1
Bosinney	1
looking	1
down	1
from	1
that	1
high	1
window	1
in	1
Sloane	1
Street,	1
straining	1
his	1
eyes	1
for	1
yet	1
another	1
glimpse	1
of	1
Irene’s	1
vanished	1
figure,	1
cooling	1
his	1
flushed	1
face,	1
dreaming	1
of	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
she	1
flung	1
herself	1
on	1
his	1
breast	1
—	1
the	1
scent	1
of	1
her	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
around,	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
her	1
laugh	1
that	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
sob?	1
Part	1

Chapter	1
24	1
Mrs.	1
Macander’s	1
Evidence	1
Many	1
people,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
including	1
the	1
editor	1
of	1
the	1
‘Ultra	1
Vivisectionist,’	1
then	1
in	1
the	1
bloom	1
of	1
its	1
first	1
youth,	1
would	1
say	1
that	1
Soames	1
was	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
man	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
removed	1
the	1
locks	1
from	1
his	1
wife’s	1
doors,	1
and,	1
after	1
beating	1
her	1
soundly,	1
resumed	1
wedded	1
happiness.	1
Brutality	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
deplorably	1
diluted	1
by	1
humaneness	1
as	1
it	1
used	1
to	1
be,	1
yet	1
a	1
sentimental	1
segment	1
of	1
the	1
population	1
may	1
still	1
be	1
relieved	1
to	1
learn	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
none	1
of	1
these	1
things.	1
For	1
active	1
brutality	1
is	1
not	1
popular	1
with	1
Forsytes;	1
they	1
are	1
too	1
circumspect,	1
and,	1
on	1
the	1
whole,	1
too	1
softhearted.	1
And	1
in	1
Soames	1
there	1
was	1
some	1
common	1
pride,	1
not	1
sufficient	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
do	1
a	1
really	1
generous	1
action,	1
but	1
enough	1
to	1
prevent	1
his	1
indulging	1
in	1
an	1
extremely	1
mean	1
one,	1
except,	1
perhaps,	1
in	1
very	1
hot	1
blood.	1
Above	1
all	1
this	1
a	1
true	1
Forsyte	1
refused	1
to	1
feel	1
himself	1
ridiculous.	1
Short	1
of	1
actually	1
beating	1
his	1
wife,	1
he	1
perceived	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
done;	1
he	1
therefore	1
accepted	1
the	1
situation	1
without	1
another	1
word.	1
Throughout	1
the	1
summer	1
and	1
autumn	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
office,	1
to	1
sort	1
his	1
pictures,	1
and	1
ask	1
his	1
friends	1
to	1
dinner.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
leave	1
town;	1
Irene	1
refused	1
to	1
go	1
away.	1
The	1
house	1
at	1
Robin	1
Hill,	1
finished	1
though	1
it	1
was,	1
remained	1
empty	1
and	1
ownerless.	1
Soames	1
had	1
brought	1
a	1
suit	1
against	1
the	1
Buccaneer,	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
claimed	1
from	1
him	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
pounds.	1

and	1
Able,	1
had	1
put	1
in	1
a	1
defence	1
on	1
Bosinney’s	1
behalf.	1
Admitting	1
the	1
facts,	1
they	1
raised	1
a	1
point	1
on	1
the	1
correspondence	1
which,	1
divested	1
of	1
legal	1
phraseology,	1
amounted	1
to	1
this:	1
To	1
speak	1
of	1
‘a	1
free	1
hand	1
in	1
the	1
terms	1
of	1
this	1
correspondence’	1
is	1
an	1
Irish	1
bull.	1
By	1
a	1
chance,	1
fortuitous	1
but	1
not	1
improbable	1
in	1
the	1
close	1
borough	1
of	1
legal	1
circles,	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
of	1
information	1
came	1
to	1
Soames’	1
ear	1
anent	1
this	1
line	1
of	1
policy,	1
the	1
working	1
partner	1
in	1
his	1
firm,	1
Bustard,	1
happening	1
to	1
sit	1
next	1
at	1
dinner	1
at	1
Walmisley’s,	1
the	1
Taxing	1
Master,	1
to	1
young	1
Chankery,	1
of	1
the	1
Common	1
Law	1
Bar.	1
The	1
necessity	1
for	1
talking	1
what	1
is	1
known	1
as	1
‘shop,’	1
which	1
comes	1
on	1
all	1
lawyers	1
with	1
the	1
removal	1
of	1
the	1
ladies,	1
caused	1
Chankery,	1
a	1
young	1
and	1
promising	1
advocate,	1
to	1
propound	1
an	1
impersonal	1
conundrum	1
to	1
his	1
neighbour,	1
whose	1
name	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know,	1
for,	1
seated	1
as	1
he	1
permanently	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
background,	1
Bustard	1
had	1
practically	1
no	1
name.	1
He	1
had,	1
said	1
Chankery,	1
a	1
case	1
coming	1
on	1
with	1
a	1
‘very	1
nice	1
point.’	1
He	1
then	1
explained,	1
preserving	1
every	1
professional	1
discretion,	1
the	1
riddle	1
in	1
Soames’	1
case.	1
Everyone,	1
he	1
said,	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
spoken,	1
thought	1
it	1
a	1
nice	1
point.	1
The	1
issue	1
was	1
small	1
unfortunately,	1
‘though	1
d	1
——	1
d	1
serious	1
for	1
his	1
client	1
he	1
believed’—	1
Walmisley’s	1
champagne	1
was	1
bad	1
but	1
plentiful.	1
A	1
Judge	1
would	1
make	1
short	1
work	1
of	1
it,	1
he	1
was	1
afraid.	1
He	1
intended	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
big	1
effort	1
—	1
the	1
point	1
was	1
a	1
nice	1
one.	1
What	1
did	1
his	1
neighbour	1
say?	1
Bustard,	1
a	1
model	1
of	1
secrecy,	1
said	1
nothing.	1
He	1
related	1
the	1
incident	1
to	1
Soames	1
however	1
with	1
some	1
malice,	1
for	1
this	1
quiet	1
man	1
was	1
capable	1
of	1
human	1
feeling,	1
ending	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
opinion	1
that	1
the	1
point	1
was	1
‘a	1
very	1
nice	1
one.’	1
In	1
accordance	1
with	1
his	1
resolve,	1
our	1
Forsyte	1
had	1
put	1
his	1
interests	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
Jobling	1
and	1
Boulter.	1
From	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
doing	1
so	1
he	1
regretted	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
acted	1
for	1
himself.	1
On	1
receiving	1
a	1
copy	1
of	1
Bosinney’s	1
defence	1
he	1
went	1
over	1
to	1
their	1
offices.	1
Boulter,	1
who	1
had	1
the	1
matter	1
in	1
hand,	1
Jobling	1
having	1
died	1
some	1
years	1
before,	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
in	1
his	1
opinion	1
it	1
was	1
rather	1
a	1
nice	1
point;	1
he	1
would	1
like	1
counsel’s	1
opinion	1
on	1
it.	1
Soames	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
a	1
good	1
man,	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
to	1
Waterbuck,	1
Q.C.,	1
marking	1
him	1
ten	1
and	1
one,	1
who	1
kept	1
the	1
papers	1
six	1
weeks	1
and	1
then	1
wrote	1
as	1
follows:	1
‘In	1
my	1
opinion	1
the	1
true	1
interpretation	1
of	1
this	1
correspondence	1
depends	1
very	1
much	1
on	1
the	1
intention	1
of	1
the	1
parties,	1
and	1
will	1
turn	1
upon	1
the	1
evidence	1
given	1
at	1
the	1
trial.	1
I	1
am	1
of	1
opinion	1
that	1
an	1
attempt	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
to	1
secure	1
from	1
the	1
architect	1
an	1
admission	1
that	1
he	1
understood	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
spend	1
at	1
the	1
outside	1
more	1
than	1
twelve	1
thousand	1
and	1
fifty	1
pounds.	1
With	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
expression,	1
“a	1
free	1
hand	1
in	1
the	1
terms	1
of	1
this	1
correspondence,”	1
to	1
which	1
my	1
attention	1
is	1
directed,	1
the	1
point	1
is	1
a	1
nice	1
one;	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
of	1
opinion	1
that	1
upon	1
the	1
whole	1
the	1
ruling	1
in	1
“Boileau	1
v.	1
The	1
Blasted	1
Cement	1
Co.,	1
Ltd.,”	1
will	1
apply.’	1
Upon	1
this	1
opinion	1
they	1
acted,	1
administering	1
interrogatories,	1
but	1
to	1
their	1
annoyance	1
Messrs.	1
Freak	1
and	1
Able	1
answered	1
these	1
in	1
so	1
masterly	1
a	1
fashion	1
that	1
nothing	1
whatever	1
was	1
admitted	1
and	1
that	1
without	1
prejudice.	1
It	1
was	1
on	1
October	1
1	1
that	1
Soames	1
read	1
Waterbuck’s	1
opinion,	1
in	1
the	1
dining-room	1
before	1
dinner.	1
It	1
made	1
him	1
nervous;	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
‘Boileau	1
v.	1
The	1
Blasted	1
Cement	1
Co.,	1
Ltd.,’	1
as	1
that	1
the	1
point	1
had	1
lately	1
begun	1
to	1
seem	1
to	1
him,	1
too,	1
a	1
nice	1
one;	1
there	1
was	1
about	1
it	1
just	1
that	1
pleasant	1
flavour	1
of	1
subtlety	1
so	1
attractive	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
legal	1
appetites.	1
To	1
have	1
his	1
own	1
impression	1
confirmed	1
by	1
Waterbuck,	1
Q.C.,	1
would	1
have	1
disturbed	1
any	1
man.	1
He	1
sat	1
thinking	1
it	1
over,	1
and	1
staring	1
at	1
the	1
empty	1
grate,	1
for	1
though	1
autumn	1
had	1
come,	1
the	1
weather	1
kept	1
as	1
gloriously	1
fine	1
that	1
jubilee	1
year	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
still	1
high	1
August.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
pleasant	1
to	1
be	1
disturbed;	1
he	1
desired	1
too	1
passionately	1
to	1
set	1
his	1
foot	1
on	1
Bosinney’s	1
neck.	1
Though	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
the	1
architect	1
since	1
the	1
last	1
afternoon	1
at	1
Robin	1
Hill,	1
he	1
was	1
never	1
free	1
from	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
his	1
presence	1
—	1
never	1
free	1
from	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
his	1
worn	1
face	1
with	1
its	1
high	1
cheek	1
bones	1
and	1
enthusiastic	1
eyes.	1
It	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
too	1
much	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
got	1
rid	1
of	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
that	1
night	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
peacock’s	1
cry	1
at	1
dawn	1
—	1
the	1
feeling	1
that	1
Bosinney	1
haunted	1
the	1
house.	1
And	1
every	1
man’s	1
shape	1
that	1
he	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
evenings	1
walking	1
past,	1
seemed	1
that	1
of	1
him	1
whom	1
George	1
had	1
so	1
appropriately	1
named	1
the	1
Buccaneer.	1
Irene	1
still	1
met	1
him,	1
he	1
was	1
certain;	1
where,	1
or	1
how,	1
he	1
neither	1
knew,	1
nor	1
asked;	1
deterred	1
by	1
a	1
vague	1
and	1
secret	1
dread	1
of	1
too	1
much	1
knowledge.	1
It	1
all	1
seemed	1
subterranean	1
nowadays.	1
Sometimes	1
when	1
he	1
questioned	1
his	1
wife	1
as	1
to	1
where	1
she	1
had	1
been,	1
which	1
he	1
still	1
made	1
a	1
point	1
of	1
doing,	1
as	1
every	1
Forsyte	1
should,	1
she	1
looked	1
very	1
strange.	1
Her	1
self-possession	1
was	1
wonderful,	1
but	1
there	1
were	1
moments	1
when,	1
behind	1
the	1
mask	1
of	1
her	1
face,	1
inscrutable	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
to	1
him,	1
lurked	1
an	1
expression	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
used	1
to	1
see	1
there.	1
She	1
had	1
taken	1
to	1
lunching	1
out	1
too;	1
when	1
he	1
asked	1
Bilson	1
if	1
her	1
mistress	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
to	1
lunch,	1
as	1
often	1
as	1
not	1
she	1
would	1
answer:	1
“No,	1
sir.”	1
He	1
strongly	1
disapproved	1
of	1
her	1
gadding	1
about	1
by	1
herself,	1
and	1
told	1
her	1
so.	1
But	1
she	1
took	1
no	1
notice.	1
There	1
was	1
something	1
that	1
angered,	1
amazed,	1
yet	1
almost	1
amused	1
him	1
about	1
the	1
calm	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
disregarded	1
his	1
wishes.	1
It	1
was	1
really	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
hugging	1
to	1
herself	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
a	1
triumph	1
over	1
him.	1
He	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
perusal	1
of	1
Waterbuck,	1
Q.C.‘s	1
opinion,	1
and,	1
going	1
upstairs,	1
entered	1
her	1
room,	1
for	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
lock	1
her	1
doors	1
till	1
bed-time	1
—	1
she	1
had	1
the	1
decency,	1
he	1
found,	1
to	1
save	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
the	1
servants.	1
She	1
was	1
brushing	1
her	1
hair,	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
strange	1
fierceness.	1
“What	1
do	1
you	1
want?”	1
she	1
said.	1
“Please	1
leave	1
my	1
room!”	1
He	1
answered:	1
“I	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
how	1
long	1
this	1
state	1
of	1
things	1
between	1
us	1
is	1
to	1
last?	1
I	1
have	1
put	1
up	1
with	1
it	1
long	1
enough.”	1
“Will	1
you	1
please	1
leave	1
my	1
room?”	1
“Will	1
you	1
treat	1
me	1
as	1
your	1
husband?”	1
“No.”	1
“Then,	1
I	1
shall	1
take	1
steps	1
to	1
make	1
you.”	1
“Do!”	1
He	1
stared,	1
amazed	1
at	1
the	1
calmness	1
of	1
her	1
answer.	1
Her	1
lips	1
were	1
compressed	1
in	1
a	1
thin	1
line;	1
her	1
hair	1
lay	1
in	1
fluffy	1
masses	1
on	1
her	1
bare	1
shoulders,	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
strange	1
golden	1
contrast	1
to	1
her	1
dark	1
eyes	1
—	1
those	1
eyes	1
alive	1
with	1
the	1
emotions	1
of	1
fear,	1
hate,	1
contempt,	1
and	1
odd,	1
haunting	1
triumph.	1
“Now,	1
please,	1
will	1
you	1
leave	1
my	1
room?”	1
He	1
turned	1
round,	1
and	1
went	1
sulkily	1
out.	1
He	1
knew	1
very	1
well	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
intention	1
of	1
taking	1
steps,	1
and	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
knew	1
too	1
—	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
to.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
habit	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
the	1
doings	1
of	1
his	1
day:	1
how	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
clients	1
had	1
called;	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
arranged	1
a	1
mortgage	1
for	1
Parkes;	1
how	1
that	1
long-standing	1
suit	1
of	1
Fryer	1
v.	1
Forsyte	1
was	1
getting	1
on,	1
which,	1
arising	1
in	1
the	1
preternaturally	1
careful	1
disposition	1
of	1
his	1
property	1
by	1
his	1
great	1
uncle	1
Nicholas,	1
who	1
had	1
tied	1
it	1
up	1
so	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
get	1
at	1
it	1
at	1
all,	1
seemed	1
likely	1
to	1
remain	1
a	1
source	1
of	1
income	1
for	1
several	1
solicitors	1
till	1
the	1
Day	1
of	1
Judgment.	1
And	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
called	1
in	1
at	1
Jobson’s,	1
and	1
seen	1
a	1
Boucher	1
sold,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
missed	1
buying	1
of	1
Talleyrand	1
and	1
Sons	1
in	1
Pall	1
Mall.	1
He	1
had	1
an	1
admiration	1
for	1
Boucher,	1
Watteau,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
school.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
habit	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
all	1
these	1
matters,	1
and	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
even	1
now,	1
talking	1
for	1
long	1
spells	1
at	1
dinner,	1
as	1
though	1
by	1
the	1
volubility	1
of	1
words	1
he	1
could	1
conceal	1
from	1
himself	1
the	1
ache	1
in	1
his	1
heart.	1
Often,	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
alone,	1
he	1
made	1
an	1
attempt	1
to	1
kiss	1
her	1
when	1
she	1
said	1
good-night.	1
He	1
may	1
have	1
had	1
some	1
vague	1
notion	1
that	1
some	1
night	1
she	1
would	1
let	1
him;	1
or	1
perhaps	1
only	1
the	1
feeling	1
that	1
a	1
husband	1
ought	1
to	1
kiss	1
his	1
wife.	1
Even	1
if	1
she	1
hated	1
him,	1
he	1
at	1
all	1
events	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
put	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
wrong	1
by	1
neglecting	1
this	1
ancient	1
rite.	1
And	1
why	1
did	1
she	1
hate	1
him?	1
Even	1
now	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
altogether	1
believe	1
it.	1
It	1
was	1
strange	1
to	1
be	1
hated!	1
—	1
the	1
emotion	1
was	1
too	1
extreme;	1
yet	1
he	1
hated	1
Bosinney,	1
that	1
Buccaneer,	1
that	1
prowling	1
vagabond,	1
that	1
night-wanderer.	1
For	1
in	1
his	1
thoughts	1
Soames	1
always	1
saw	1
him	1
lying	1
in	1
wait	1
—	1
wandering.	1
Ah,	1
but	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
in	1
very	1
low	1
water!	1
Young	1
Burkitt,	1
the	1
architect,	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
coming	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
third-rate	1
restaurant,	1
looking	1
terribly	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
mouth!	1
During	1
all	1
the	1
hours	1
he	1
lay	1
awake,	1
thinking	1
over	1
the	1
situation,	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
no	1
end	1
—	1
unless	1
she	1
should	1
suddenly	1
come	1
to	1
her	1
senses	1
—	1
never	1
once	1
did	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
separating	1
from	1
his	1
wife	1
seriously	1
enter	1
his	1
head.	1
.	3
And	1
the	1
Forsytes!	1
What	1
part	1
did	1
they	1
play	1
in	1
this	1
stage	1
of	1
Soames’	1
subterranean	1
tragedy?	1
Truth	1
to	1
say,	1
little	1
or	1
none,	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
sea.	1
From	1
hotels,	1
hydropathics,	1
or	1
lodging-houses,	1
they	1
were	1
bathing	1
daily;	1
laying	1
in	1
a	1
stock	1
of	1
ozone	1
to	1
last	1
them	1
through	1
the	1
winter.	1
Each	1
section,	1
in	1
the	1
vineyard	1
of	1
its	1
own	1
choosing,	1
grew	1
and	1
culled	1
and	1
pressed	1
and	1
bottled	1
the	1
grapes	1
of	1
a	1
pet	1
sea-air.	1
The	1
end	1
of	1
September	1
began	1
to	1
witness	1
their	1
several	1
returns.	1
In	1
rude	1
health	1
and	1
small	1
omnibuses,	1
with	1
considerable	1
colour	1
in	1
their	1
cheeks,	1
they	1
arrived	1
daily	1
from	1
the	1
various	1
termini.	1
The	1
following	1
morning	1
saw	1
them	1
back	1
at	1
their	1
vocations.	1
On	1
the	1
next	1
Sunday	1
Timothy’s	1
was	1
thronged	1
from	1
lunch	1
till	1
dinner.	1
Amongst	1
other	1
gossip,	1
too	1
numerous	1
and	1
interesting	1
to	1
relate,	1
Mrs.	1
Septimus	1
Small	1
mentioned	1
that	1
Soames	1
and	1
Irene	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
away.	1
It	1
remained	1
for	1
a	1
comparative	1
outsider	1
to	1
supply	1
the	1
next	1
evidence	1
of	1
interest.	1
It	1
chanced	1
that	1
one	1
afternoon	1
late	1
in	1
September,	1
Mrs.	1
MacAnder,	1
Winifred	1
Dartie’s	1
greatest	1
friend,	1
taking	1
a	1
constitutional,	1
with	1
young	1
Augustus	1
Flippard,	1
on	1
her	1
bicycle	1
in	1
Richmond	1
Park,	1
passed	1
Irene	1
and	1
Bosinney	1
walking	1
from	1
the	1
bracken	1
towards	1
the	1
Sheen	1
Gate.	1
Perhaps	1
the	1
poor	1
little	1
woman	1
was	1
thirsty,	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
ridden	1
long	1
on	1
a	1
hard,	1
dry	1
road,	1
and,	1
as	1
all	1
London	1
knows,	1
to	1
ride	1
a	1
bicycle	1
and	1
talk	1
to	1
young	1
Flippard	1
will	1
try	1
the	1
toughest	1
constitution;	1
or	1
perhaps	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
cool	1
bracken	1
grove,	1
whence	1
‘those	1
two’	1
were	1
coming	1
down,	1
excited	1
her	1
envy.	1
The	1
cool	1
bracken	1
grove	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
hill,	1
with	1
the	1
oak	1
boughs	1
for	1
roof,	1
where	1
the	1
pigeons	1
were	1
raising	1
an	1
endless	1
wedding	1
hymn,	1
and	1
the	1
autumn,	1
humming,	1
whispered	1
to	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
lovers	1
in	1
the	1
fern,	1
while	1
the	1
deer	1
stole	1
by.	1
The	1
bracken	1
grove	1
of	1
irretrievable	1
delights,	1
of	1
golden	1
minutes	1
in	1
the	1
long	1
marriage	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth!	1
The	1
bracken	1
grove,	1
sacred	1
to	1
stags,	1
to	1
strange	1
tree-stump	1
fauns	1
leaping	1
around	1
the	1
silver	1
whiteness	1
of	1
a	1
birch-tree	1
nymph	1
at	1
summer	1
dusk.	1
This	1
lady	1
knew	1
all	1
the	1
Forsytes,	1
and	1
having	1
been	1
at	1
June’s	1
‘at	1
home,’	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
a	1
loss	1
to	1
see	1
with	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
deal.	1
Her	1
own	1
marriage,	1
poor	1
thing,	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
successful,	1
but	1
having	1
had	1
the	1
good	1
sense	1
and	1
ability	1
to	1
force	1
her	1
husband	1
into	1
pronounced	1
error,	1
she	1
herself	1
had	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
necessary	1
divorce	1
proceedings	1
without	1
incurring	1
censure.	1
She	1
was	1
therefore	1
a	1
judge	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
thing,	1
and	1
lived	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
large	1
buildings,	1
where	1
in	1
small	1
sets	1
of	1
apartments,	1
are	1
gathered	1
incredible	1
quantities	1
of	1
Forsytes,	1
whose	1
chief	1
recreation	1
out	1
of	1
business	1
hours	1
is	1
the	1
discussion	1
of	1
each	1
other’s	1
affairs.	1
Poor	1
little	1
woman,	1
perhaps	1
she	1
was	1
thirsty,	1
certainly	1
she	1
was	1
bored,	1
for	1
Flippard	1
was	1
a	1
wit.	1
To	1
see	1
‘those	1
two’	1
in	1
so	1
unlikely	1
a	1
spot	1
was	1
quite	1
a	1
merciful	1
‘pick-me-up.’	1
At	1
the	1
MacAnder,	1
like	1
all	1
London,	1
Time	1
pauses.	1
This	1
small	1
but	1
remarkable	1
woman	1
merits	1
attention;	1
her	1
all-seeing	1
eye	1
and	1
shrewd	1
tongue	1
were	1
inscrutably	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
furthering	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
Providence.	1
With	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
being	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
death,	1
she	1
had	1
an	1
almost	1
distressing	1
power	1
of	1
taking	1
care	1
of	1
herself.	1
She	1
had	1
done	1
more,	1
perhaps,	1
in	1
her	1
way	1
than	1
any	1
woman	1
about	1
town	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
chivalry	1
which	1
still	1
clogs	1
the	1
wheel	1
of	1
civilization.	1
So	1
smart	1
she	1
was,	1
and	1
spoken	1
of	1
endearingly	1
as	1
‘the	1
little	1
MacAnder!’	1
Dressing	1
tightly	1
and	1
well,	1
she	1
belonged	1
to	1
a	1
Woman’s	1
Club,	1
but	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
the	1
neurotic	1
and	1
dismal	1
type	1
of	1
member	1
who	1
was	1
always	1
thinking	1
of	1
her	1
rights.	1
She	1
took	1
her	1
rights	1
unconsciously,	1
they	1
came	1
natural	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
she	1
knew	1
exactly	1
how	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
most	1
of	1
them	1
without	1
exciting	1
anything	1
but	1
admiration	1
amongst	1
that	1
great	1
class	1
to	1
whom	1
she	1
was	1
affiliated,	1
not	1
precisely	1
perhaps	1
by	1
manner,	1
but	1
by	1
birth,	1
breeding,	1
and	1
the	1
true,	1
the	1
secret	1
gauge,	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
property.	1
The	1
daughter	1
of	1
a	1
Bedfordshire	1
solicitor,	1
by	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
a	1
clergyman,	1
she	1
had	1
never,	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
painful	1
experience	1
of	1
being	1
married	1
to	1
a	1
very	1
mild	1
painter	1
with	1
a	1
cranky	1
love	1
of	1
Nature,	1
who	1
had	1
deserted	1
her	1
for	1
an	1
actress,	1
lost	1
touch	1
with	1
the	1
requirements,	1
beliefs,	1
and	1
inner	1
feeling	1
of	1
Society;	1
and,	1
on	1
attaining	1
her	1
liberty,	1
she	1
placed	1
herself	1
without	1
effort	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
van	1
of	1
Forsyteism.	1
Always	1
in	1
good	1
spirits,	1
and	1
‘full	1
of	1
information,’	1
she	1
was	1
universally	1
welcomed.	1
She	1
excited	1
neither	1
surprise	1
nor	1
disapprobation	1
when	1
encountered	1
on	1
the	1
Rhine	1
or	1
at	1
Zermatt,	1
either	1
alone,	1
or	1
travelling	1
with	1
a	1
lady	1
and	1
two	1
gentlemen;	1
it	1
was	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
perfectly	1
capable	1
of	1
taking	1
care	1
of	1
herself;	1
and	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
all	1
Forsytes	1
warmed	1
to	1
that	1
wonderful	1
instinct,	1
which	1
enabled	1
her	1
to	1
enjoy	1
everything	1
without	1
giving	1
anything	1
away.	1
It	1
was	1
generally	1
felt	1
that	1
to	1
such	1
women	1
as	1
Mrs.	1
MacAnder	1
should	1
we	1
look	1
for	1
the	1
perpetuation	1
and	1
increase	1
of	1
our	1
best	1
type	1
of	1
woman.	1
She	1
had	1
never	1
had	1
any	1
children.	1
If	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
thing	1
more	1
than	1
another	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
stand	1
it	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
soft	1
women	1
with	1
what	1
men	1
called	1
‘charm’	1
about	1
them,	1
and	1
for	1
Mrs.	1
Soames	1
she	1
always	1
had	1
an	1
especial	1
dislike.	1
Obscurely,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
if	1
charm	1
were	1
once	1
admitted	1
as	1
the	1
criterion,	1
smartness	1
and	1
capability	1
must	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
wall;	1
and	1
she	1
hated	1
—	1
with	1
a	1
hatred	1
the	1
deeper	1
that	1
at	1
times	1
this	1
so-called	1
charm	1
seemed	1
to	1
disturb	1
all	1
calculations	1
—	1
the	1
subtle	1
seductiveness	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
altogether	1
overlook	1
in	1
Irene.	1
She	1
said,	1
however,	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
see	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
woman	1
—	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
‘go’	1
about	1
her	1
—	1
she	1
would	1
never	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
stand	1
up	1
for	1
herself	1
—	1
anyone	1
could	1
take	1
advantage	1
of	1
her,	1
that	1
was	1
plain	1
—	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
in	1
fact	1
what	1
men	1
found	1
to	1
admire!	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
really	1
ill-natured,	1
but,	1
in	1
maintaining	1
her	1
position	1
after	1
the	1
trying	1
circumstances	1
of	1
her	1
married	1
life,	1
she	1
had	1
found	1
it	1
so	1
necessary	1
to	1
be	1
‘full	1
of	1
information,’	1
that	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
holding	1
her	1
tongue	1
about	1
‘those	1
two’	1
in	1
the	1
Park	1
never	1
occurred	1
to	1
her.	1
And	1
it	1
so	1
happened	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
dining	1
that	1
very	1
evening	1
at	1
Timothy’s,	1
where	1
she	1
went	1
sometimes	1
to	1
‘cheer	1
the	1
old	1
things	1
up,’	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
wont	1
to	1
put	1
it.	1
The	1
same	1
people	1
were	1
always	1
asked	1
to	1
meet	1
her:	1
Winifred	1
Dartie	1
and	1
her	1
husband;	1
Francie,	1
because	1
she	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
artistic	1
circles,	1
for	1
Mrs.	1
MacAnder	1
was	1
known	1
to	1
contribute	1
articles	1
on	1
dress	1
to	1
‘The	1
Ladies	1
Kingdom	1
Come’;	1
and	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
flirt	1
with,	1
provided	1
they	1
could	1
be	1
obtained,	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
Hayman	1
boys,	1
who,	1
though	1
they	1
never	1
said	1
anything,	1
were	1
believed	1
to	1
be	1
fast	1
and	1
thoroughly	1
intimate	1
with	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
latest	1
in	1
smart	1
Society.	1
At	1
twenty-five	1
minutes	1
past	1
seven	1
she	1
turned	1
out	1
the	1
electric	1
light	1
in	1
her	1
little	1
hall,	1
and	1
wrapped	1
in	1
her	1
opera	1
cloak	1
with	1
the	1
chinchilla	1
collar,	1
came	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
corridor,	1
pausing	1
a	1
moment	1
to	1
make	1
sure	1
she	1
had	1
her	1
latch-key.	1
These	1
little	1
self-contained	1
flats	1
were	1
convenient;	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
light	1
and	1
no	1
air,	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
shut	1
it	1
up	1
whenever	1
she	1
liked	1
and	1
go	1
away.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
bother	1
with	1
servants,	1
and	1
she	1
never	1
felt	1
tied	1
as	1
she	1
used	1
to	1
when	1
poor,	1
dear	1
Fred	1
was	1
always	1
about,	1
in	1
his	1
mooney	1
way.	1
She	1
retained	1
no	1
rancour	1
against	1
poor,	1
dear	1
Fred,	1
he	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
fool;	1
but	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
that	1
actress	1
drew	1
from	1
her,	1
even	1
now,	1
a	1
little,	1
bitter,	1
derisive	1
smile.	1
Firmly	1
snapping	1
the	1
door	1
to,	1
she	1
crossed	1
the	1
corridor,	1
with	1
its	1
gloomy,	1
yellow-ochre	1
walls,	1
and	1
its	1
infinite	1
vista	1
of	1
brown,	1
numbered	1
doors.	1
The	1
lift	1
was	1
going	1
down;	1
and	1
wrapped	1
to	1
the	1
ears	1
in	1
the	1
high	1
cloak,	1
with	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
auburn	1
hairs	1
in	1
its	1
place,	1
she	1
waited	1
motionless	1
for	1
it	1
to	1
stop	1
at	1
her	1
floor.	1
The	1
iron	1
gates	1
clanked	1
open;	1
she	1
entered.	1
There	1
were	1
already	1
three	1
occupants,	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
white	1
waistcoat,	1
with	1
a	1
large,	1
smooth	1
face	1
like	1
a	1
baby’s,	1
and	1
two	1
old	1
ladies	1
in	1
black,	1
with	1
mittened	1
hands.	1
Mrs.	1
MacAnder	1
smiled	1
at	1
them;	1
she	1
knew	1
everybody;	1
and	1
all	1
these	1
three,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
admirably	1
silent	1
before,	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
at	1
once.	1
This	1
was	1
Mrs.	1
MacAnder’s	1
successful	1
secret.	1
She	1
provoked	1
conversation.	1
Throughout	1
a	1
descent	1
of	1
five	1
stories	1
the	1
conversation	1
continued,	1
the	1
lift	1
boy	1
standing	1
with	1
his	1
back	1
turned,	1
his	1
cynical	1
face	1
protruding	1
through	1
the	1
bars.	1
At	1
the	1
bottom	1
they	1
separated,	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
white	1
waistcoat	1
sentimentally	1
to	1
the	1
billiard	1
room,	1
the	1
old	1
ladies	1
to	1
dine	1
and	1
say	1
to	1
each	1
other:	1
“A	1
dear	1
little	1
woman!”	1
“Such	1
a	1
rattle!”	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
MacAnder	1
to	1
her	1
cab.	1
When	1
Mrs.	1
MacAnder	1
dined	1
at	1
Timothy’s,	1
the	1
conversation	1
(although	1
Timothy	1
himself	1
could	1
never	1
be	1
induced	1
to	1
be	1
present)	1
took	1
that	1
wider,	1
man-of-the-world	1
tone	1
current	1
among	1
Forsytes	1
at	1
large,	1
and	1
this,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
was	1
what	1
put	1
her	1
at	1
a	1
premium	1
there.	1
Mrs.	1
Small	1
and	1
Aunt	1
Hester	1
found	1
it	1
an	1
exhilarating	1
change.	1
“If	1
only,”	1
they	1
said,	1
“Timothy	1
would	1
meet	1
her!”	1
It	1
was	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
do	1
him	1
good.	1
She	1
could	1
tell	1
you,	1
for	1
instance,	1
the	1
latest	1
story	1
of	1
Sir	1
Charles	1
Fiste’s	1
son	1
at	1
Monte	1
Carlo;	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
real	1
heroine	1
of	1
Tynemouth	1
Eddy’s	1
fashionable	1
novel	1
that	1
everyone	1
was	1
holding	1
up	1
their	1
hands	1
over,	1
and	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
doing	1
in	1
Paris	1
about	1
wearing	1
bloomers.	1
She	1
was	1
so	1
sensible,	1
too,	1
knowing	1
all	1
about	1
that	1
vexed	1
question,	1
whether	1
to	1
send	1
young	1
Nicholas’	1
eldest	1
into	1
the	1
navy	1
as	1
his	1
mother	1
wished,	1
or	1
make	1
him	1
an	1
accountant	1
as	1
his	1
father	1
thought	1
would	1
be	1
safer.	1
She	1
strongly	1
deprecated	1
the	1
navy.	1
If	1
you	1
were	1
not	1
exceptionally	1
brilliant	1
or	1
exceptionally	1
well	1
connected,	1
they	1
passed	1
you	1
over	1
so	1
disgracefully,	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
it	1
after	1
all	1
to	1
look	1
forward	1
to,	1
even	1
if	1
you	1
became	1
an	1
admiral	1
—	1
a	1
pittance!	1
An	1
accountant	1
had	1
many	1
more	1
chances,	1
but	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
put	1
with	1
a	1
good	1
firm,	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
risk	1
at	1
starting!	1
Sometimes	1
she	1
would	1
give	1
them	1
a	1
tip	1
on	1
the	1
Stock	1
Exchange;	1
not	1
that	1
Mrs.	1
Small	1
or	1
Aunt	1
Hester	1
ever	1
took	1
it.	1
They	1
had	1
indeed	1
no	1
money	1
to	1
invest;	1
but	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
bring	1
them	1
into	1
such	1
exciting	1
touch	1
with	1
the	1
realities	1
of	1
life.	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
event.	1
They	1
would	1
ask	1
Timothy,	1
they	1
said.	1
But	1
they	1
never	1
did,	1
knowing	1
in	1
advance	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
upset	1
him.	1
Surreptitiously,	1
however,	1
for	1
weeks	1
after	1
they	1
would	1
look	1
in	1
that	1
paper,	1
which	1
they	1
took	1
with	1
respect	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
its	1
really	1
fashionable	1
proclivities,	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
‘Bright’s	1
Rubies’	1
or	1
‘The	1
Woollen	1
Mackintosh	1
Company’	1
were	1
up	1
or	1
down.	1
Sometimes	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
company	1
at	1
all;	1
and	1
they	1
would	1
wait	1
until	1
James	1
or	1
Roger	1
or	1
even	1
Swithin	1
came	1
in,	1
and	1
ask	1
them	1
in	1
voices	1
trembling	1
with	1
curiosity	1
how	1
that	1
‘Bolivia	1
Lime	1
and	1
Speltrate’	1
was	1
doing	1
—	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
paper.	1
And	1
Roger	1
would	1
answer:	1
“What	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
for?	1
Some	1
trash!	1
You’ll	1
go	1
burning	1
your	1
fingers	1
—	1
investing	1
your	1
money	1
in	1
lime,	1
and	1
things	1
you	1
know	1
nothing	1
about!	1
Who	1
told	1
you?”	1
and	1
ascertaining	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
told,	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
away,	1
and,	1
making	1
inquiries	1
in	1
the	1
City,	1
would	1
perhaps	1
invest	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
money	1
in	1
the	1
concern.	1
It	1
was	1
about	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
dinner,	1
just	1
in	1
fact	1
as	1
the	1
saddle	1
of	1
mutton	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
in	1
by	1
Smither,	1
that	1
Mrs.	1
MacAnder,	1
looking	1
airily	1
round,	1
said:	1
“Oh!	1
and	1
whom	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
I	1
passed	1
to-day	1
in	1
Richmond	1
Park?	1
You’ll	1
never	1
guess	1
—	1
Mrs.	1
Soames	1
and	1
—	1
Mr.	1
Bosinney.	1
They	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
down	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
house!”	1
Winifred	1
Dartie	1
coughed,	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
said	1
a	1
word.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
piece	1
of	1
evidence	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
unconsciously	1
been	1
waiting	1
for.	1
To	1
do	1
Mrs.	1
MacAnder	1
justice,	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
Switzerland	1
and	1
the	1
Italian	1
lakes	1
with	1
a	1
party	1
of	1
three,	1
and	1
had	1
not	1
heard	1
of	1
Soames’	1
rupture	1
with	1
his	1
architect.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
tell,	1
therefore,	1
the	1
profound	1
impression	1
her	1
words	1
would	1
make.	1
Upright	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
flushed,	1
she	1
moved	1
her	1
small,	1
shrewd	1
eyes	1
from	1
face	1
to	1
face,	1
trying	1
to	1
gauge	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
her	1
words.	1
On	1
either	1
side	1
of	1
her	1
a	1
Hayman	1
boy,	1
his	1
lean,	1
taciturn,	1
hungry	1
face	1
turned	1
towards	1
his	1
plate,	1
ate	1
his	1
mutton	1
steadily.	1
These	1
two,	1
Giles	1
and	1
Jesse,	1
were	1
so	1
alike	1
and	1
so	1
inseparable	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
known	1
as	1
the	1
Dromios.	1
They	1
never	1
talked,	1
and	1
seemed	1
always	1
completely	1
occupied	1
in	1
doing	1
nothing.	1
It	1
was	1
popularly	1
supposed	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
cramming	1
for	1
an	1
important	1
examination.	1
They	1
walked	1
without	1
hats	1
for	1
long	1
hours	1
in	1
the	1
Gardens	1
attached	1
to	1
their	1
house,	1
books	1
in	1
their	1
hands,	1
a	1
fox-terrier	1
at	1
their	1
heels,	1
never	1
saying	1
a	1
word,	1
and	1
smoking	1
all	1
the	1
time.	1
Every	1
morning,	1
about	1
fifty	1
yards	1
apart,	1
they	1
trotted	1
down	1
Campden	1
Hill	1
on	1
two	1
lean	1
hacks,	1
with	1
legs	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
their	1
own,	1
and	1
every	1
morning	1
about	1
an	1
hour	1
later,	1
still	1
fifty	1
yards	1
apart,	1
they	1
cantered	1
up	1
again.	1
Every	1
evening,	1
wherever	1
they	1
had	1
dined,	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
observed	1
about	1
half-past	1
ten,	1
leaning	1
over	1
the	1
balustrade	1
of	1
the	1
Alhambra	1
promenade.	1
They	1
were	1
never	1
seen	1
otherwise	1
than	1
together;	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
passing	1
their	1
lives,	1
apparently	1
perfectly	1
content.	1
Inspired	1
by	1
some	1
dumb	1
stirring	1
within	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
gentlemen,	1
they	1
turned	1
at	1
this	1
painful	1
moment	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
MacAnder,	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
precisely	1
the	1
same	1
voice:	1
“Have	1
you	1
seen	1
the	1
.	2
.?”	1
Such	1
was	1
her	1
surprise	1
at	1
being	1
thus	1
addressed	1
that	1
she	1
put	1
down	1
her	1
fork;	1
and	1
Smither,	1
who	1
was	1
passing,	1
promptly	1
removed	1
her	1
plate.	1
Mrs.	1
MacAnder,	1
however,	1
with	1
presence	1
of	1
mind,	1
said	1
instantly:	1
“I	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
little	1
more	1
of	1
that	1
nice	1
mutton.”	1
But	1
afterwards	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
—	1
room	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
by	1
Mrs.	1
Small,	1
determined	1
to	1
get	1
to	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
matter.	1
And	1
she	1
began:	1
“What	1
a	1
charming	1
woman,	1
Mrs.	1
Soames;	1
such	1
a	1
sympathetic	1
temperament!	1
Soames	1
is	1
a	1
really	1
lucky	1
man!”	1
Her	1
anxiety	1
for	1
information	1
had	1
not	1
made	1
sufficient	1
allowance	1
for	1
that	1
inner	1
Forsyte	1
skin	1
which	1
refuses	1
to	1
share	1
its	1
troubles	1
with	1
outsiders.	1
Mrs.	1
Septimus	1
Small,	1
drawing	1
herself	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
creak	1
and	1
rustle	1
of	1
her	1
whole	1
person,	1
said,	1
shivering	1
in	1
her	1
dignity:	1
“My	1
dear,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
subject	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
talk	1
about!”	1
Chapter	1
25	1
Night	1
in	1
the	1
Park	1
Although	1
with	1
her	1
infallible	1
instinct	1
Mrs.	1
Small	1
had	1
said	1
the	1
very	1
thing	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
guest	1
‘more	1
intriguee	1
than	1
ever,’	1
it	1
is	1
difficult	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
else	1
she	1
could	1
truthfully	1
have	1
spoken.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
subject	1
which	1
the	1
Forsytes	1
could	1
talk	1
about	1
even	1
among	1
themselves	1
—	1
to	1
use	1
the	1
word	1
Soames	1
had	1
invented	1
to	1
characterize	1
to	1
himself	1
the	1
situation,	1
it	1
was	1
‘subterranean.’	1
Yet,	1
within	1
a	1
week	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
MacAnder’s	1
encounter	1
in	1
Richmond	1
Park,	1
to	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
—	1
save	1
Timothy,	1
from	1
whom	1
it	1
was	1
carefully	1
kept	1
—	1
to	1
James	1
on	1
his	1
domestic	1
beat	1
from	1
the	1
Poultry	1
to	1
Park	1
Lane,	1
to	1
George	1
the	1
wild	1
one,	1
on	1
his	1
daily	1
adventure	1
from	1
the	1
bow	1
window	1
at	1
the	1
Haversnake	1
to	1
the	1
billiard	1
room	1
at	1
the	1
‘Red	1
Pottle,’	1
was	1
it	1
known	1
that	1
‘those	1
two’	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
extremes.	1
George	1
(it	1
was	1
he	1
who	1
invented	1
many	1
of	1
those	1
striking	1
expressions	1
still	1
current	1
in	1
fashionable	1
circles)	1
voiced	1
the	1
sentiment	1
more	1
accurately	1
than	1
any	1
one	1
when	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
brother	1
Eustace	1
that	1
‘the	1
Buccaneer’	1
was	1
‘going	1
it’;	1
he	1
expected	1
Soames	1
was	1
about	1
‘fed	1
up.’	1
It	1
was	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
be,	1
and	1
yet,	1
what	1
could	1
be	1
done?	1
He	1
ought	1
perhaps	1
to	1
take	1
steps;	1
but	1
to	1
take	1
steps	1
would	1
be	1
deplorable.	1
Without	1
an	1
open	1
scandal	1
which	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
their	1
way	1
to	1
recommending,	1
it	1
was	1
difficult	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
steps	1
could	1
be	1
taken.	1
In	1
this	1
impasse,	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
was	1
to	1
say	1
nothing	1
to	1
Soames,	1
and	1
nothing	1
to	1
each	1
other;	1
in	1
fact,	1
to	1
pass	1
it	1
over.	1
By	1
displaying	1
towards	1
Irene	1
a	1
dignified	1
coldness,	1
some	1
impression	1
might	1
be	1
made	1
upon	1
her;	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
seldom	1
now	1
to	1
be	1
seen,	1
and	1
there	1
seemed	1
a	1
slight	1
difficulty	1
in	1
seeking	1
her	1
out	1
on	1
purpose	1
to	1
show	1
her	1
coldness.	1
Sometimes	1
in	1
the	1
privacy	1
of	1
his	1
bedroom	1
James	1
would	1
reveal	1
to	1
Emily	1
the	1
real	1
suffering	1
that	1
his	1
son’s	1
misfortune	1
caused	1
him.	1
“I	1
can’t	1
tell,”	1
he	1
would	1
say;	1
“it	1
worries	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
life.	1
There’ll	1
be	1
a	1
scandal,	1
and	1
that’ll	1
do	1
him	1
no	1
good.	1
I	1
shan’t	1
say	1
anything	1
to	1
him.	1
There	1
might	1
be	1
nothing	1
in	1
it.	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think?	1
She’s	1
very	1
artistic,	1
they	1
tell	1
me.	1
What?	1
Oh,	1
you’re	1
a	1
‘regular	1
Juley!	1
Well,	1
I	1
don’t	1
know;	1
I	1
expect	1
the	1
worst.	1
This	1
is	1
what	1
comes	1
of	1
having	1
no	1
children.	1
I	1
knew	1
how	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
from	1
the	1
first.	1
They	1
never	1
told	1
me	1
they	1
didn’t	1
mean	1
to	1
have	1
any	1
children	1
—	1
nobody	1
tells	1
me	1
anything!”	1
On	1
his	1
knees	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
bed,	1
his	1
eyes	1
open	1
and	1
fixed	1
with	1
worry,	1
he	1
would	1
breathe	1
into	1
the	1
counterpane.	1
Clad	1
in	1
his	1
nightshirt,	1
his	1
neck	1
poked	1
forward,	1
his	1
back	1
rounded,	1
he	1
resembled	1
some	1
long	1
white	1
bird.	1
“Our	1
Father-,”	1
he	1
repeated,	1
turning	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
again	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
this	1
possible	1
scandal.	1
Like	1
old	1
Jolyon,	1
he,	1
too,	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
set	1
the	1
blame	1
of	1
the	1
tragedy	1
down	1
to	1
family	1
interference.	1
What	1
business	1
had	1
that	1
lot	1
—	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
Stanhope	1
Gate	1
branch,	1
including	1
young	1
Jolyon	1
and	1
his	1
daughter,	1
as	1
‘that	1
lot’—	1
to	1
introduce	1
a	1
person	1
like	1
this	1
Bosinney	1
into	1
the	1
family?	1
(He	1
had	1
heard	1
George’s	1
soubriquet,	1
‘The	1
Buccaneer,’	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
make	1
nothing	1
of	1
that	1
—	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
was	1
an	1
architect.)	1
He	1
began	1
to	1
feel	1
that	1
his	1
brother	1
Jolyon,	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
looked	1
up	1
and	1
on	1
whose	1
opinion	1
he	1
had	1
relied,	1
was	1
not	1
quite	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
expected.	1
Not	1
having	1
his	1
eldest	1
brother’s	1
force	1
of	1
character,	1
he	1
was	1
more	1
sad	1
than	1
angry.	1
His	1
great	1
comfort	1
was	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Winifred’s,	1
and	1
take	1
the	1
little	1
Darties	1
in	1
his	1
carriage	1
over	1
to	1
Kensington	1
Gardens,	1
and	1
there,	1
by	1
the	1
Round	1
Pond,	1
he	1
could	1
often	1
be	1
seen	1
walking	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
anxiously	1
on	1
little	1
Publius	1
Dartie’s	1
sailing-boat,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
himself	1
freighted	1
with	1
a	1
penny,	1
as	1
though	1
convinced	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
never	1
again	1
come	1
to	1
shore;	1
while	1
little	1
Publius	1
—	1
who,	1
James	1
delighted	1
to	1
say,	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
bit	1
like	1
his	1
father	1
skipping	1
along	1
under	1
his	1
lee,	1
would	1
try	1
to	1
get	1
him	1
to	1
bet	1
another	1
that	1
it	1
never	1
would,	1
having	1
found	1
that	1
it	1
always	1
did.	1
And	1
James	1
would	1
make	1
the	1
bet;	1
he	1
always	1
paid	1
—	1
sometimes	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
pennies	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon,	1
for	1
the	1
game	1
seemed	1
never	1
to	1
pall	1
on	1
little	1
Publius	1
—	1
and	1
always	1
in	1
paying	1
he	1
said:	1
“Now,	1
that’s	1
for	1
your	1
money-box.	1
Why,	1
you’re	1
getting	1
quite	1
a	1
rich	1
man!”	1
The	1
thought	1
of	1
his	1
little	1
grandson’s	1
growing	1
wealth	1
was	1
a	1
real	1
pleasure	1
to	1
him.	1
But	1
little	1
Publius	1
knew	1
a	1
sweet-shop,	1
and	1
a	1
trick	1
worth	1
two	1
of	1
that.	1
And	1
they	1
would	1
walk	1
home	1
across	1
the	1
Park,	1
James’	1
figure,	1
with	1
high	1
shoulders	1
and	1
absorbed	1
and	1
worried	1
face,	1
exercising	1
its	1
tall,	1
lean	1
protectorship,	1
pathetically	1
unregarded,	1
over	1
the	1
robust	1
child-figures	1
of	1
Imogen	1
and	1
little	1
Publius.	1
But	1
those	1
Gardens	1
and	1
that	1
Park	1
were	1
not	1
sacred	1
to	1
James.	1
Forsytes	1
and	1
tramps,	1
children	1
and	1
lovers,	1
rested	1
and	1
wandered	1
day	1
after	1
day,	1
night	1
after	1
night,	1
seeking	1
one	1
and	1
all	1
some	1
freedom	1
from	1
labour,	1
from	1
the	1
reek	1
and	1
turmoil	1
of	1
the	1
streets.	1
The	1
leaves	1
browned	1
slowly,	1
lingering	1
with	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
summer-like	1
warmth	1
of	1
the	1
nights.	1
On	1
Saturday,	1
October	1
5,	1
the	1
sky	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
blue	1
all	1
day	1
deepened	1
after	1
sunset	1
to	1
the	1
bloom	1
of	1
purple	1
grapes.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
moon,	1
and	1
a	1
clear	1
dark,	1
like	1
some	1
velvety	1
garment,	1
was	1
wrapped	1
around	1
the	1
trees,	1
whose	1
thinned	1
branches,	1
resembling	1
plumes,	1
stirred	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
still,	1
warm	1
air.	1
All	1
London	1
had	1
poured	1
into	1
the	1
Park,	1
draining	1
the	1
cup	1
of	1
summer	1
to	1
its	1
dregs.	1
Couple	1
after	1
couple,	1
from	1
every	1
gate,	1
they	1
streamed	1
along	1
the	1
paths	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
burnt	1
grass,	1
and	1
one	1
after	1
another,	1
silently	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
lighted	1
spaces,	1
stole	1
into	1
the	1
shelter	1
of	1
the	1
feathery	1
trees,	1
where,	1
blotted	1
against	1
some	1
trunk,	1
or	1
under	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
shrubs,	1
they	1
were	1
lost	1
to	1
all	1
but	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
soft	1
darkness.	1
To	1
fresh-comers	1
along	1
the	1
paths,	1
these	1
forerunners	1
formed	1
but	1
part	1
of	1
that	1
passionate	1
dusk,	1
whence	1
only	1
a	1
strange	1
murmur,	1
like	1
the	1
confused	1
beating	1
of	1
hearts,	1
came	1
forth.	1
But	1
when	1
that	1
murmur	1
reached	1
each	1
couple	1
in	1
the	1
lamp-light	1
their	1
voices	1
wavered,	1
and	1
ceased;	1
their	1
arms	1
enlaced,	1
their	1
eyes	1
began	1
seeking,	1
searching,	1
probing	1
the	1
blackness.	1
Suddenly,	1
as	1
though	1
drawn	1
by	1
invisible	1
hands,	1
they,	1
too,	1
stepped	1
over	1
the	1
railing,	1
and,	1
silent	1
as	1
shadows,	1
were	1
gone	1
from	1
the	1
light.	1
The	1
stillness,	1
enclosed	1
in	1
the	1
far,	1
inexorable	1
roar	1
of	1
the	1
town,	1
was	1
alive	1
with	1
the	1
myriad	1
passions,	1
hopes,	1
and	1
loves	1
of	1
multitudes	1
of	1
struggling	1
human	1
atoms;	1
for	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
disapproval	1
of	1
that	1
great	1
body	1
of	1
Forsytes,	1
the	1
Municipal	1
Council	1
—	1
to	1
whom	1
Love	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
considered,	1
next	1
to	1
the	1
Sewage	1
Question,	1
the	1
gravest	1
danger	1
to	1
the	1
community	1
—	1
a	1
process	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
that	1
night	1
in	1
the	1
Park,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
hundred	1
other	1
parks,	1
without	1
which	1
the	1
thousand	1
factories,	1
churches,	1
shops,	1
taxes,	1
and	1
drains,	1
of	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
custodians,	1
were	1
as	1
arteries	1
without	1
blood,	1
a	1
man	1
without	1
a	1
heart.	1
The	1
instincts	1
of	1
self-forgetfulness,	1
of	1
passion,	1
and	1
of	1
love,	1
hiding	1
under	1
the	1
trees,	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
trustees	1
of	1
their	1
remorseless	1
enemy,	1
the	1
‘sense	1
of	1
property,’	1
were	1
holding	1
a	1
stealthy	1
revel,	1
and	1
Soames,	1
returning	1
from	1
Bayswater	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
alone	1
to	1
dine	1
at	1
Timothy’s	1
walking	1
home	1
along	1
the	1
water,	1
with	1
his	1
mind	1
upon	1
that	1
coming	1
lawsuit,	1
had	1
the	1
blood	1
driven	1
from	1
his	1
heart	1
by	1
a	1
low	1
laugh	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
kisses.	1
He	1
thought	1
of	1
writing	1
to	1
the	1
Times	1
the	1
next	1
morning,	1
to	1
draw	1
the	1
attention	1
of	1
the	1
Editor	1
to	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
our	1
parks.	1
He	1
did	1
not,	1
however,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
horror	1
of	1
seeing	1
his	1
name	1
in	1
print.	1
But	1
starved	1
as	1
he	1
was,	1
the	1
whispered	1
sounds	1
in	1
the	1
stillness,	1
the	1
half-seen	1
forms	1
in	1
the	1
dark,	1
acted	1
on	1
him	1
like	1
some	1
morbid	1
stimulant.	1
He	1
left	1
the	1
path	1
along	1
the	1
water	1
and	1
stole	1
under	1
the	1
trees,	1
along	1
the	1
deep	1
shadow	1
of	1
little	1
plantations,	1
where	1
the	1
boughs	1
of	1
chestnut	1
trees	1
hung	1
their	1
great	1
leaves	1
low,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
blacker	1
refuge,	1
shaping	1
his	1
course	1
in	1
circles	1
which	1
had	1
for	1
their	1
object	1
a	1
stealthy	1
inspection	1
of	1
chairs	1
side	1
by	1
side,	1
against	1
tree-trunks,	1
of	1
enlaced	1
lovers,	1
who	1
stirred	1
at	1
his	1
approach.	1
Now	1
he	1
stood	1
still	1
on	1
the	1
rise	1
overlooking	1
the	1
Serpentine,	1
where,	1
in	1
full	1
lamp-light,	1
black	1
against	1
the	1
silver	1
water,	1
sat	1
a	1
couple	1
who	1
never	1
moved,	1
the	1
woman’s	1
face	1
buried	1
on	1
the	1
man’s	1
neck	1
—	1
a	1
single	1
form,	1
like	1
a	1
carved	1
emblem	1
of	1
passion,	1
silent	1
and	1
unashamed.	1
And,	1
stung	1
by	1
the	1
sight,	1
Soames	1
hurried	1
on	1
deeper	1
into	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
the	1
trees.	1
In	1
this	1
search,	1
who	1
knows	1
what	1
he	1
thought	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
sought?	1
Bread	1
for	1
hunger	1
—	1
light	1
in	1
darkness?	1
Who	1
knows	1
what	1
he	1
expected	1
to	1
find	1
—	1
impersonal	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
heart	1
—	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
his	1
private	1
subterranean	1
tragedy	1
—	1
for,	1
again,	1
who	1
knew,	1
but	1
that	1
each	1
dark	1
couple,	1
unnamed,	1
unnameable,	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
he	1
and	1
she?	1
But	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
such	1
knowledge	1
as	1
this	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
seeking	1
—	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Soames	1
Forsyte	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
Park	1
like	1
a	1
common	1
wench!	1
Such	1
thoughts	1
were	1
inconceivable;	1
and	1
from	1
tree	1
to	1
tree,	1
with	1
his	1
noiseless	1
step,	1
he	1
passed.	1
Once	1
he	1
was	1
sworn	1
at;	1
once	1
the	1
whisper,	1
“If	1
only	1
it	1
could	1
always	1
be	1
like	1
this!”	1
sent	1
the	1
blood	1
flying	1
again	1
from	1
his	1
heart,	1
and	1
he	1
waited	1
there,	1
patient	1
and	1
dogged,	1
for	1
the	1
two	1
to	1
move.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
poor	1
thin	1
slip	1
of	1
a	1
shop-girl	1
in	1
her	1
draggled	1
blouse	1
who	1
passed	1
him,	1
clinging	1
to	1
her	1
lover’s	1
arm.	1
A	1
hundred	1
other	1
lovers	1
too	1
whispered	1
that	1
hope	1
in	1
the	1
stillness	1
of	1
the	1
trees,	1
a	1
hundred	1
other	1
lovers	1
clung	1
to	1
each	1
other.	1
But	1
shaking	1
himself	1
with	1
sudden	1
disgust,	1
Soames	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
path,	1
and	1
left	1
that	1
seeking	1
for	1
he	1
knew	1
not	1
what.	1
Chapter	1
26	1
Meeting	1
at	1
the	1
Botanical	1
Young	1
Jolyon,	1
whose	1
circumstances	1
were	1
not	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
Forsyte,	1
found	1
at	1
times	1
a	1
difficulty	1
in	1
sparing	1
the	1
money	1
needful	1
for	1
those	1
country	1
jaunts	1
and	1
researches	1
into	1
Nature,	1
without	1
having	1
prosecuted	1
which	1
no	1
watercolour	1
artist	1
ever	1
puts	1
brush	1
to	1
paper.	1
He	1
was	1
frequently,	1
in	1
fact,	1
obliged	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
colour-box	1
into	1
the	1
Botanical	1
Gardens,	1
and	1
there,	1
on	1
his	1
stool,	1
in	1
the	1
shade	1
of	1
a	1
monkey-puzzler	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
lee	1
of	1
some	1
India-rubber	1
plant,	1
he	1
would	1
spend	1
long	1
hours	1
sketching.	1
An	1
Art	1
critic	1
who	1
had	1
recently	1
been	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
work	1
had	1
delivered	1
himself	1
as	1
follows:	1
“In	1
a	1
way	1
your	1
drawings	1
are	1
very	1
good;	1
tone	1
and	1
colour,	1
in	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
certainly	1
quite	1
a	1
feeling	1
for	1
Nature.	1
But,	1
you	1
see,	1
they’re	1
so	1
scattered;	1
you’ll	1
never	1
get	1
the	1
public	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
them.	1
Now,	1
if	1
you’d	1
taken	1
a	1
definite	1
subject,	1
such	1
as	1
‘London	1
by	1
Night,’	1
or	1
‘The	1
Crystal	1
Palace	1
in	1
the	1
Spring,’	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
regular	1
series,	1
the	1
public	1
would	1
have	1
known	1
at	1
once	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
looking	1
at.	1
I	1
can’t	1
lay	1
too	1
much	1
stress	1
upon	1
that.	1
All	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
are	1
making	1
great	1
names	1
in	1
Art,	1
like	1
Crum	1
Stone	1
or	1
Bleeder,	1
are	1
making	1
them	1
by	1
avoiding	1
the	1
unexpected;	1
by	1
specializing	1
and	1
putting	1
their	1
works	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
pigeon-hole,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
public	1
know	1
pat	1
once	1
where	1
to	1
go.	1
And	1
this	1
stands	1
to	1
reason,	1
for	1
if	1
a	1
man’s	1
a	1
collector	1
he	1
doesn’t	1
want	1
people	1
to	1
smell	1
at	1
the	1
canvas	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
whom	1
his	1
pictures	1
are	1
by;	1
he	1
wants	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
say	1
at	1
once,	1
‘A	1
capital	1
Forsyte!’	1
It	1
is	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
important	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
careful	1
to	1
choose	1
a	1
subject	1
that	1
they	1
can	1
lay	1
hold	1
of	1
on	1
the	1
spot,	1
since	1
there’s	1
no	1
very	1
marked	1
originality	1
in	1
your	1
style.”	1
Young	1
Jolyon,	1
standing	1
by	1
the	1
little	1
piano,	1
where	1
a	1
bowl	1
of	1
dried	1
rose	1
leaves,	1
the	1
only	1
produce	1
of	1
the	1
garden,	1
was	1
deposited	1
on	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
faded	1
damask,	1
listened	1
with	1
his	1
dim	1
smile.	1
Turning	1
to	1
his	1
wife,	1
who	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
speaker	1
with	1
an	1
angry	1
expression	1
on	1
her	1
thin	1
face,	1
he	1
said:	1
“You	1
see,	1
dear?”	1
“I	1
do	1
not,”	1
she	1
answered	1
in	1
her	1
staccato	1
voice,	1
that	1
still	1
had	1
a	1
little	1
foreign	1
accent;	1
“your	1
style	1
has	1
originality.”	1
The	1
critic	1
looked	1
at	1
her,	1
smiled’	1
deferentially,	1
and	1
said	1
no	1
more.	1
Like	1
everyone	1
else,	1
he	1
knew	1
their	1
history.	1
The	1
words	1
bore	1
good	1
fruit	1
with	1
young	1
Jolyon;	1
they	1
were	1
contrary	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
believed	1
in,	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
theoretically	1
held	1
good	1
in	1
his	1
Art,	1
but	1
some	1
strange,	1
deep	1
instinct	1
moved	1
him	1
against	1
his	1
will	1
to	1
turn	1
them	1
to	1
profit.	1
He	1
discovered	1
therefore	1
one	1
morning	1
that	1
an	1
idea	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
making	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
watercolour	1
drawings	1
of	1
London.	1
How	1
the	1
idea	1
had	1
arisen	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
tell;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
till	1
the	1
following	1
year,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
completed	1
and	1
sold	1
them	1
at	1
a	1
very	1
fair	1
price,	1
that	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
impersonal	1
moods,	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
able	1
to	1
recollect	1
the	1
Art	1
critic,	1
and	1
to	1
discover	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
achievement	1
another	1
proof	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
Forsyte.	1
He	1
decided	1
to	1
commence	1
with	1
the	1
Botanical	1
Gardens,	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
made	1
so	1
many	1
studies,	1
and	1
chose	1
the	1
little	1
artificial	1
pond,	1
sprinkled	1
now	1
with	1
an	1
autumn	1
shower	1
of	1
red	1
and	1
yellow	1
leaves,	1
for	1
though	1
the	1
gardeners	1
longed	1
to	1
sweep	1
them	1
off,	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
reach	1
them	1
with	1
their	1
brooms.	1
The	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
gardens	1
they	1
swept	1
bare	1
enough,	1
removing	1
every	1
morning	1
Nature’s	1
rain	1
of	1
leaves;	1
piling	1
them	1
in	1
heaps,	1
whence	1
from	1
slow	1
fires	1
rose	1
the	1
sweet,	1
acrid	1
smoke	1
that,	1
like	1
the	1
cuckoo’s	1
note	1
for	1
spring,	1
the	1
scent	1
of	1
lime	1
trees	1
for	1
the	1
summer,	1
is	1
the	1
true	1
emblem	1
of	1
the	1
fall.	1
The	1
gardeners’	1
tidy	1
souls	1
could	1
not	1
abide	1
the	1
gold	1
and	1
green	1
and	1
russet	1
pattern	1
on	1
the	1
grass.	1
The	1
gravel	1
paths	1
must	1
lie	1
unstained,	1
ordered,	1
methodical,	1
without	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
realities	1
of	1
life,	1
nor	1
of	1
that	1
slow	1
and	1
beautiful	1
decay	1
which	1
flings	1
crowns	1
underfoot	1
to	1
star	1
the	1
earth	1
with	1
fallen	1
glories,	1
whence,	1
as	1
the	1
cycle	1
rolls,	1
will	1
leap	1
again	1
wild	1
spring.	1
Thus	1
each	1
leaf	1
that	1
fell	1
was	1
marked	1
from	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
it	1
fluttered	1
a	1
good-bye	1
and	1
dropped,	1
slow	1
turning,	1
from	1
its	1
twig.	1
But	1
on	1
that	1
little	1
pond	1
the	1
leaves	1
floated	1
in	1
peace,	1
and	1
praised	1
Heaven	1
with	1
their	1
hues,	1
the	1
sunlight	1
haunting	1
over	1
them.	1
And	1
so	1
young	1
Jolyon	1
found	1
them.	1
Coming	1
there	1
one	1
morning	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
October,	1
he	1
was	1
disconcerted	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
bench	1
about	1
twenty	1
paces	1
from	1
his	1
stand	1
occupied,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
proper	1
horror	1
of	1
anyone	1
seeing	1
him	1
at	1
work.	1
A	1
lady	1
in	1
a	1
velvet	1
jacket	1
was	1
sitting	1
there,	1
with	1
her	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
ground.	1
A	1
flowering	1
laurel,	1
however,	1
stood	1
between,	1
and,	1
taking	1
shelter	1
behind	1
this,	1
young	1
Jolyon	1
prepared	1
his	1
easel.	1
His	1
preparations	1
were	1
leisurely;	1
he	1
caught,	1
as	1
every	1
true	1
artist	1
should,	1
at	1
anything	1
that	1
might	1
delay	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
the	1
effort	1
of	1
his	1
work,	1
and	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
looking	1
furtively	1
at	1
this	1
unknown	1
dame.	1
Like	1
his	1
father	1
before	1
him,	1
he	1
had	1
an	1
eye	1
for	1
a	1
face.	1
This	1
face	1
was	1
charming!	1
He	1
saw	1
a	1
rounded	1
chin	1
nestling	1
in	1
a	1
cream	1
ruffle,	1
a	1
delicate	1
face	1
with	1
large	1
dark	1
eyes	1
and	1
soft	1
lips.	1
A	1
black	1
‘picture’	1
hat	1
concealed	1
the	1
hair;	1
her	1
figure	1
was	1
lightly	1
poised	1
against	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
bench,	1
her	1
knees	1
were	1
crossed;	1
the	1
tip	1
of	1
a	1
patent-leather	1
shoe	1
emerged	1
beneath	1
her	1
skirt.	1
There	1
was	1
something,	1
indeed,	1
inexpressibly	1
dainty	1
about	1
the	1
person	1
of	1
this	1
lady,	1
but	1
young	1
Jolyon’s	1
attention	1
was	1
chiefly	1
riveted	1
by	1
the	1
look	1
on	1
her	1
face,	1
which	1
reminded	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
wife.	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
though	1
its	1
owner	1
had	1
come	1
into	1
contact	1
with	1
forces	1
too	1
strong	1
for	1
her.	1
It	1
troubled	1
him,	1
arousing	1
vague	1
feelings	1
of	1
attraction	1
and	1
chivalry.	1
Who	1
was	1
she?	1
And	1
what	1
doing	1
there,	1
alone?	1
Two	1
young	1
gentlemen	1
of	1
that	1
peculiar	1
breed,	1
at	1
once	1
forward	1
and	1
shy,	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
Regent’s	1
Park,	1
came	1
by	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
to	1
lawn	1
tennis,	1
and	1
he	1
noted	1
with	1
disapproval	1
their	1
furtive	1
stares	1
of	1
admiration.	1
A	1
loitering	1
gardener	1
halted	1
to	1
do	1
something	1
unnecessary	1
to	1
a	1
clump	1
of	1
pampas	1
grass;	1
he,	1
too,	1
wanted	1
an	1
excuse	1
for	1
peeping.	1
A	1
gentleman,	1
old,	1
and,	1
by	1
his	1
hat,	1
a	1
professor	1
of	1
horticulture,	1
passed	1
three	1
times	1
to	1
scrutinize	1
her	1
long	1
and	1
stealthily,	1
a	1
queer	1
expression	1
about	1
his	1
lips.	1
With	1
all	1
these	1
men	1
young	1
Jolyon	1
felt	1
the	1
same	1
vague	1
irritation.	1
She	1
looked	1
at	1
none	1
of	1
them,	1
yet	1
was	1
he	1
certain	1
that	1
every	1
man	1
who	1
passed	1
would	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
like	1
that.	1
Her	1
face	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
sorceress,	1
who	1
in	1
every	1
look	1
holds	1
out	1
to	1
men	1
the	1
offer	1
of	1
pleasure;	1
it	1
had	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
‘devil’s	1
beauty’	1
so	1
highly	1
prized	1
among	1
the	1
first	1
Forsytes	1
of	1
the	1
land;	1
neither	1
was	1
it	1
of	1
that	1
type,	1
no	1
less	1
adorable,	1
associated	1
with	1
the	1
box	1
of	1
chocolate;	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
spiritually	1
passionate,	1
or	1
passionately	1
spiritual	1
order,	1
peculiar	1
to	1
house-decoration	1
and	1
modern	1
poetry;	1
nor	1
did	1
it	1
seem	1
to	1
promise	1
to	1
the	1
playwright	1
material	1
for	1
the	1
production	1
of	1
the	1
interesting	1
and	1
neurasthenic	1
figure,	1
who	1
commits	1
suicide	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
act.	1
In	1
shape	1
and	1
colouring,	1
in	1
its	1
soft	1
persuasive	1
passivity,	1
its	1
sensuous	1
purity,	1
this	1
woman’s	1
face	1
reminded	1
him	1
of	1
Titian’s	1
‘Heavenly	1
Love,’	1
a	1
reproduction	1
of	1
which	1
hung	1
over	1
the	1
sideboard	1
in	1
his	1
dining-room.	1
And	1
her	1
attraction	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
this	1
soft	1
passivity,	1
in	1
the	1
feeling	1
she	1
gave	1
that	1
to	1
pressure	1
she	1
must	1
yield.	1
For	1
what	1
or	1
whom	1
was	1
she	1
waiting,	1
in	1
the	1
silence,	1
with	1
the	1
trees	1
dropping	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
a	1
leaf,	1
and	1
the	1
thrushes	1
strutting	1
close	1
on	1
grass,	1
touched	1
with	1
the	1
sparkle	1
of	1
the	1
autumn	1
rime?	1
Then	1
her	1
charming	1
face	1
grew	1
eager,	1
and,	1
glancing	1
round,	1
with	1
almost	1
a	1
lover’s	1
jealousy,	1
young	1
Jolyon	1
saw	1
Bosinney	1
striding	1
across	1
the	1
grass.	1
Curiously	1
he	1
watched	1
the	1
meeting,	1
the	1
look	1
in	1
their	1
eyes,	1
the	1
long	1
clasp	1
of	1
their	1
hands.	1
They	1
sat	1
down	1
close	1
together,	1
linked	1
for	1
all	1
their	1
outward	1
discretion.	1
He	1
heard	1
the	1
rapid	1
murmur	1
of	1
their	1
talk;	1
but	1
what	1
they	1
said	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
catch.	1
He	1
had	1
rowed	1
in	1
the	1
galley	1
himself!	1
He	1
knew	1
the	1
long	1
hours	1
of	1
waiting	1
and	1
the	1
lean	1
minutes	1
of	1
a	1
half-public	1
meeting;	1
the	1
tortures	1
of	1
suspense	1
that	1
haunt	1
the	1
unhallowed	1
lover.	1
It	1
required,	1
however,	1
but	1
a	1
glance	1
at	1
their	1
two	1
faces	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
none	1
of	1
those	1
affairs	1
of	1
a	1
season	1
that	1
distract	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
about	1
town;	1
none	1
of	1
those	1
sudden	1
appetites	1
that	1
wake	1
up	1
ravening,	1
and	1
are	1
surfeited	1
and	1
asleep	1
again	1
in	1
six	1
weeks.	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
real	1
thing!	1
This	1
was	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
himself!	1
Out	1
of	1
this	1
anything	1
might	1
come!	1
Bosinney	1
was	1
pleading,	1
and	1
she	1
so	1
quiet,	1
so	1
soft,	1
yet	1
immovable	1
in	1
her	1
passivity,	1
sat	1
looking	1
over	1
the	1
grass.	1
Was	1
he	1
the	1
man	1
to	1
carry	1
her	1
off,	1
that	1
tender,	1
passive	1
being,	1
who	1
would	1
never	1
stir	1
a	1
step	1
for	1
herself?	1
Who	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
all	1
herself,	1
and	1
would	1
die	1
for	1
him,	1
but	1
perhaps	1
would	1
never	1
run	1
away	1
with	1
him!	1
It	1
seemed	1
to	1
young	1
Jolyon	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
hear	1
her	1
saying:	1
“But,	1
darling,	1
it	1
would	1
ruin	1
you!”	1
For	1
he	1
himself	1
had	1
experienced	1
to	1
the	1
full	1
the	1
gnawing	1
fear	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
each	1
woman’s	1
heart	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
drag	1
on	1
the	1
man	1
she	1
loves.	1
And	1
he	1
peeped	1
at	1
them	1
no	1
more;	1
but	1
their	1
soft,	1
rapid	1
talk	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
ears,	1
with	1
the	1
stuttering	1
song	1
of	1
some	1
bird	1
who	1
seemed	1
trying	1
to	1
remember	1
the	1
notes	1
of	1
spring:	1
Joy	1
—	1
tragedy?	1
Which	1
—	1
which?	1
And	1
gradually	1
their	1
talk	1
ceased;	1
long	1
silence	1
followed.	1
‘And	1
where	1
does	1
Soames	1
come	1
in?’	1
young	1
Jolyon	1
thought.	1
‘People	1
think	1
she	1
is	1
concerned	1
about	1
the	1
sin	1
of	1
deceiving	1
her	1
husband!	1
Little	1
they	1
know	1
of	1
women!	1
She’s	1
eating,	1
after	1
starvation	1
—	1
taking	1
her	1
revenge!	1
And	1
Heaven	1
help	1
her	1
—	1
for	1
he’ll	1
take	1
his.’	1
He	1
heard	1
the	1
swish	1
of	1
silk,	1
and,	1
spying	1
round	1
the	1
laurel,	1
saw	1
them	1
walking	1
away,	1
their	1
hands	1
stealthily	1
joined.	1
.	3
At	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
July	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
had	1
taken	1
his	1
grand-daughter	1
to	1
the	1
mountains;	1
and	1
on	1
that	1
visit	1
(the	1
last	1
they	1
ever	1
paid)	1
June	1
recovered	1
to	1
a	1
great	1
extent	1
her	1
health	1
and	1
spirits.	1
In	1
the	1
hotels,	1
filled	1
with	1
British	1
Forsytes	1
—	1
for	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
a	1
‘set	1
of	1
Germans,’	1
as	1
he	1
called	1
all	1
foreigners	1
—	1
she	1
was	1
looked	1
upon	1
with	1
respect	1
—	1
the	1
only	1
grand-daughter	1
of	1
that	1
fine-looking,	1
and	1
evidently	1
wealthy,	1
old	1
Mr.	1
Forsyte.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
mix	1
freely	1
with	1
people	1
—	1
to	1
mix	1
freely	1
with	1
people	1
was	1
not	1
June’s	1
habit	1
—	1
but	1
she	1
formed	1
some	1
friendships,	1
and	1
notably	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
Rhone	1
Valley,	1
with	1
a	1
French	1
girl	1
who	1
was	1
dying	1
of	1
consumption.	1
Determining	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
her	1
friend	1
should	1
not	1
die,	1
she	1
forgot,	1
in	1
the	1
institution	1
of	1
a	1
campaign	1
against	1
Death,	1
much	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
trouble.	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
watched	1
the	1
new	1
intimacy	1
with	1
relief	1
and	1
disapproval;	1
for	1
this	1
additional	1
proof	1
that	1
her	1
life	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
passed	1
amongst	1
‘lame	1
ducks’	1
worried	1
him.	1
Would	1
she	1
never	1
make	1
a	1
friendship	1
or	1
take	1
an	1
interest	1
in	1
something	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
of	1
real	1
benefit	1
to	1
her?	1
‘Taking	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
parcel	1
of	1
foreigners,’	1
he	1
called	1
it.	1
He	1
often,	1
however,	1
brought	1
home	1
grapes	1
or	1
roses,	1
and	1
presented	1
them	1
to	1
‘Mam’zelle’	1
with	1
an	1
ingratiating	1
twinkle.	1
Towards	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
September,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
June’s	1
disapproval,	1
Mademoiselle	1
Vigor	1
breathed	1
her	1
last	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
hotel	1
at	1
St.	1
Luc,	1
to	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
moved	1
her;	1
and	1
June	1
took	1
her	1
defeat	1
so	1
deeply	1
to	1
heart	1
that	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
carried	1
her	1
away	1
to	1
Paris.	1
Here,	1
in	1
contemplation	1
of	1
the	1
‘Venus	1
de	1
Milo’	1
and	1
the	1
‘Madeleine,’	1
she	1
shook	1
off	1
her	1
depression,	1
and	1
when,	1
towards	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
October,	1
they	1
returned	1
to	1
town,	1
her	1
grandfather	1
believed	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
effected	1
a	1
cure.	1
No	1
sooner,	1
however,	1
had	1
they	1
established	1
themselves	1
in	1
Stanhope	1
Gate	1
than	1
he	1
perceived	1
to	1
his	1
dismay	1
a	1
return	1
of	1
her	1
old	1
absorbed	1
and	1
brooding	1
manner.	1
She	1
would	1
sit,	1
staring	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
her,	1
her	1
chin	1
on	1
her	1
hand,	1
like	1
a	1
little	1
Norse	1
spirit,	1
grim	1
and	1
intent,	1
while	1
all	1
around	1
in	1
the	1
electric	1
light,	1
then	1
just	1
installed,	1
shone	1
the	1
great,	1
drawing-room	1
brocaded	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
frieze,	1
full	1
of	1
furniture	1
from	1
Baple	1
and	1
Pullbred’s.	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
huge	1
gilt	1
mirror	1
were	1
reflected	1
those	1
Dresden	1
china	1
groups	1
of	1
young	1
men	1
in	1
tight	1
knee	1
breeches,	1
at	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
full-bosomed	1
ladies	1
nursing	1
on	1
their	1
laps	1
pet	1
lambs,	1
which	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
had	1
bought	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
bachelor	1
and	1
thought	1
so	1
highly	1
of	1
in	1
these	1
days	1
of	1
degenerate	1
taste.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
most	1
open	1
mind,	1
who,	1
more	1
than	1
any	1
Forsyte	1
of	1
them	1
all,	1
had	1
moved	1
with	1
the	1
times,	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
never	1
forget	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
bought	1
these	1
groups	1
at	1
Jobson’s,	1
and	1
given	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
money	1
for	1
them.	1
He	1
often	1
said	1
to	1
June,	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
disillusioned	1
contempt:	1
“You	1
don’t	1
care	1
about	1
them!	1
They’re	1
not	1
the	1
gimcrack	1
things	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
friends	1
like,	1
but	1
they	1
cost	1
me	1
seventy	1
pounds!”	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
allowed	1
his	1
taste	1
to	1
be	1
warped	1
when	1
he	1
knew	1
for	1
solid	1
reasons	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
sound.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
things	1
that	1
June	1
did	1
on	1
getting	1
home	1
was	1
to	1
go	1
round	1
to	1
Timothy’s.	1
She	1
persuaded	1
herself	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
her	1
duty	1
to	1
call	1
there,	1
and	1
cheer	1
him	1
with	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
all	1
her	1
travels;	1
but	1
in	1
reality	1
she	1
went	1
because	1
she	1
knew	1
of	1
no	1
other	1
place	1
where,	1
by	1
some	1
random	1
speech,	1
or	1
roundabout	1
question,	1
she	1
could	1
glean	1
news	1
of	1
Bosinney.	1
They	1
received	1
her	1
most	1
cordially:	1
And	1
how	1
was	1
her	1
dear	1
grandfather?	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
since	1
May.	1
Her	1
Uncle	1
Timothy	1
was	1
very	1
poorly,	1
he	1
had	2
a	1
lot	1
of	1
trouble	1
with	1
the	1
chimney-sweep	1
in	1
his	1
bedroom;	1
the	1
stupid	1
man	1
had	1
let	1
the	1
soot	1
down	1
the	1
chimney!	1
It	1
had	1
quite	1
upset	1
her	1
uncle.	1
June	1
sat	1
there	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
dreading,	1
yet	1
passionately	1
hoping,	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
speak	1
of	1
Bosinney.	1
But	1
paralyzed	1
by	1
unaccountable	1
discretion,	1
Mrs.	1
Septimus	1
Small	1
let	1
fall	1
no	1
word,	1
neither	1
did	1
she	1
question	1
June	1
about	1
him.	1
In	1
desperation	1
the	1
girl	1
asked	1
at	1
last	1
whether	1
Soames	1
and	1
Irene	1
were	1
in	1
town	1
—	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
been	1
to	1
see	1
anyone.	1
It	1
was	1
Aunt	1
Hester	1
who	1
replied:	1
Oh,	1
yes,	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
town,	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
away	1
at	1
all.	1
There	1
was	1
some	1
little	1
difficulty	1
about	1
the	1
house,	1
she	1
believed.	1
June	1
had	1
heard,	1
no	1
doubt!	1
She	1
had	1
better	1
ask	1
her	1
Aunt	1
Juley!	1
June	1
turned	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Small,	1
who	1
sat	1
upright	1
in	1
her	1
chair,	1
her	1
hands	1
clasped,	1
her	1
face	1
covered	1
with	1
innumerable	1
pouts.	1
In	1
answer	1
to	1
the	1
girl’s	1
look	1
she	1
maintained	1
a	1
strange	1
silence,	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
spoke	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
ask	1
June	1
whether	1
she	1
had	1
worn	1
night-socks	1
up	1
in	1
those	1
high	1
hotels	1
where	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
so	1
cold	1
of	1
a	1
night.	1
June	1
answered	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
not,	1
she	1
hated	1
the	1
stuffy	1
things;	1
and	1
rose	1
to	1
leave.	1
Mrs.	1
Small’s	1
infallibly	1
chosen	1
silence	1
was	1
far	1
more	1
ominous	1
to	1
her	1
than	1
anything	1
that	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
said.	1
Before	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
was	1
over	1
she	1
had	1
dragged	1
the	1
truth	1
from	1
Mrs.	1
Baynes	1
in	1
Lowndes	1
Square,	1
that	1
Soames	1
was	1
bringing	1
an	1
action	1
against	1
Bosinney	1
over	1
the	1
decoration	1
of	1
the	1
house.	1
Instead	1
of	1
disturbing	1
her,	1
the	1
news	1
had	1
a	1
strangely	1
calming	1
effect;	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
this	1
struggle	1
new	1
hope	1
for	1
herself.	1
She	1
learnt	1
that	1
the	1
case	1
was	1
expected	1
to	1
come	1
on	1
in	1
about	1
a	1
month,	1
and	1
there	1
seemed	1
little	1
or	1
no	1
prospect	1
of	1
Bosinney’s	1
success.	1
“And	1
whatever	1
he’ll	1
do	1
I	1
can’t	1
think,”	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Baynes;	1
“it’s	1
very	1
dreadful	1
for	1
him,	1
you	1
know	1
—	1
he’s	1
got	1
no	1
money	1
—	1
he’s	1
very	1
hard	1
up.	1
And	1
we	1
can’t	1
help	1
him,	1
I’m	1
sure.	1
I’m	1
told	1
the	1
money-lenders	1
won’t	1
lend	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
no	1
security,	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
none	1
—	1
none	1
at	1
all.”	1
Her	1
embonpoint	1
had	1
increased	1
of	1
late;	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
full	1
swing	1
of	1
autumn	1
organization,	1
her	1
writing-table	1
literally	1
strewn	1
with	1
the	1
menus	1
of	1
charity	1
functions.	1
She	1
looked	1
meaningly	1
at	1
June,	1
with	1
her	1
round	1
eyes	1
of	1
parrot-grey.	1
The	1
sudden	1
flush	1
that	1
rose	1
on	1
the	1
girl’s	1
intent	1
young	1
face	1
—	1
she	1
must	1
have	1
seen	1
spring	1
up	1
before	1
her	1
a	1
great	1
hope	1
—	1
the	1
sudden	1
sweetness	1
of	1
her	1
smile,	1
often	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
Lady	1
Baynes	1
in	1
after	1
years	1
(Baynes	1
was	1
knighted	1
when	1
he	1
built	1
that	1
public	1
Museum	1
of	1
Art	1
which	1
has	1
given	1
so	1
much	1
employment	1
to	1
officials,	1
and	1
so	1
little	1
pleasure	1
to	1
those	1
working	1
classes	1
for	1
whom	1
it	1
was	1
designed).	1
The	1
memory	1
of	1
that	1
change,	1
vivid	1
and	1
touching,	1
like	1
the	1
breaking	1
open	1
of	1
a	1
flower,	1
or	1
the	1
first	1
sun	1
after	1
long	1
winter,	1
the	1
memory,	1
too,	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
came	1
after,	1
often	1
intruded	1
itself,	1
unaccountably,	1
inopportunely	1
on	1
Lady	1
Baynes,	1
when	1
her	1
mind	1
was	1
set	1
upon	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
things.	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
afternoon	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
young	1
Jolyon	1
witnessed	1
the	1
meeting	1
in	1
the	1
Botanical	1
Gardens,	1
and	1
on	1
this	1
day,	1
too,	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
paid	1
a	1
visit	1
to	1
his	1
solicitors,	1
Forsyte,	1
Bustard,	1
and	1
Forsyte,	1
in	1
the	1
Poultry.	1
Soames	1
was	1
not	1
in,	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
down	1
to	1
Somerset	1
House;	1
Bustard	1
was	1
buried	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
hilt	1
in	1
papers	1
and	1
that	1
inaccessible	1
apartment,	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
judiciously	1
placed,	1
in	1
order	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
do	1
as	1
much	1
work	1
as	1
possible;	1
but	1
James	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
office,	1
biting	1
a	1
finger,	1
and	1
lugubriously	1
turning	1
over	1
the	1
pleadings	1
in	1
Forsyte	1
v.	1
Bosinney.	1
This	1
sound	1
lawyer	1
had	1
only	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
luxurious	1
dread	1
of	1
the	1
‘nice	1
point,’	1
enough	1
to	1
set	1
up	1
a	1
pleasurable	1
feeling	1
of	1
fuss;	1
for	1
his	1
good	1
practical	1
sense	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
himself	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
Bench	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
pay	1
much	1
attention	1
to	1
it.	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
that	1
this	1
Bosinney	1
would	1
go	1
bankrupt	1
and	1
Soames	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
money	1
after	1
all,	1
and	1
costs	1
into	1
the	1
bargain.	1
And	1
behind	1
this	1
tangible	1
dread	1
there	1
was	1
always	1
that	1
intangible	1
trouble,	1
lurking	1
in	1
the	1
background,	1
intricate,	1
dim,	1
scandalous,	1
like	1
a	1
bad	1
dream,	1
and	1
of	1
which	1
this	1
action	1
was	1
but	1
an	1
outward	1
and	1
visible	1
sign.	1
He	1
raised	1
his	1
head	1
as	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
came	1
in,	1
and	1
muttered:	1
“How	1
are	1
you,	1
Jolyon?	1
Haven’t	1
seen	1
you	1
for	1
an	1
age.	1
You’ve	1
been	1
to	1
Switzerland,	1
they	1
tell	1
me.	1
This	1
young	1
Bosinney,	1
he’s	1
got	1
himself	1
into	1
a	1
mess.	1
I	1
knew	1
how	1
it	1
would	1
be!”	1
He	1
held	1
out	1
the	1
papers,	1
regarding	1
his	1
elder	1
brother	1
with	1
nervous	1
gloom.	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
read	1
them	1
in	1
silence,	1
and	1
while	1
he	1
read	1
them	1
James	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
floor,	1
biting	1
his	1
fingers	1
the	1
while.	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
pitched	1
them	1
down	1
at	1
last,	1
and	1
they	1
fell	1
with	1
a	1
thump	1
amongst	1
a	1
mass	1
of	1
affidavits	1
in	1
‘re	1
Buncombe,	1
deceased,’	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
many	1
branches	1
of	1
that	1
parent	1
and	1
profitable	1
tree,	1
‘Fryer	1
v.	1
Forsyte.’	1
“I	1
don’t	1
know	1
what	1
Soames	1
is	1
about,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“to	1
make	1
a	1
fuss	1
over	1
a	1
few	1
hundred	1
pounds.	1
I	1
thought	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
property.”	1
James’	1
long	1
upper	1
lip	1
twitched	1
angrily;	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
his	1
son	1
to	1
be	1
attacked	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
spot.	1
“It’s	1
not	1
the	1
money,”	1
he	1
began,	1
but	1
meeting	1
his	1
brother’s	1
glance,	1
direct,	1
shrewd,	1
judicial,	1
he	1
stopped.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
silence.	1
“I’ve	1
come	1
in	1
for	1
my	1
Will,”	1
said	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
at	1
last,	1
tugging	1
at	1
his	1
moustache.	1
James’	1
curiosity	1
was	1
roused	1
at	1
once.	1
Perhaps	1
nothing	1
in	1
this	1
life	1
was	1
more	1
stimulating	1
to	1
him	1
than	1
a	1
Will;	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
supreme	1
deal	1
with	1
property,	1
the	1
final	1
inventory	1
of	1
a	1
man’s	1
belongings,	1
the	1
last	1
word	1
on	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
worth.	1
He	1
sounded	1
the	1
bell.	1
“Bring	1
in	1
Mr.	1
Jolyon’s	1
Will,”	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
an	1
anxious,	1
dark-haired	1
clerk.	1
“You	1
going	1
to	1
make	1
some	1
alterations?”	1
And	1
through	1
his	1
mind	1
there	1
flashed	1
the	1
thought:	1
‘Now,	1
am	1
I	1
worth	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
he?’	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
put	1
the	1
Will	1
in	1
his	1
breast	1
pocket,	1
and	1
James	1
twisted	1
his	1
long	1
legs	1
regretfully.	1
“You’ve	1
made	1
some	1
nice	1
purchases	1
lately,	1
they	1
tell	1
me,”	1
he	1
said.	1
“I	1
don’t	1
know	1
where	1
you	1
get	1
your	1
information	1
from,”	1
answered	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
sharply.	1
“When’s	1
this	1
action	1
coming	1
on?	1
Next	1
month?	1
I	1
can’t	1
tell	1
what	1
you’ve	1
got	1
in	1
your	1
minds.	1
You	1
must	1
manage	1
your	1
own	1
affairs;	1
but	1
if	1
you	1
take	1
my	1
advice,	1
you’ll	1
settle	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
Court.	1
Good-bye!”	1
With	1
a	1
cold	1
handshake	1
he	1
was	1
gone.	1
James,	1
his	1
fixed	1
grey-blue	1
eye	1
corkscrewing	1
round	1
some	1
secret	1
anxious	1
image,	1
began	1
again	1
to	1
bite	1
his	1
finger.	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
took	1
his	1
Will	1
to	1
the	1
offices	1
of	1
the	1
New	1
Colliery	1
Company,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
empty	1
Board	1
Room	1
to	1
read	1
it	1
through.	1
He	1
answered	1
‘Down-by-the-starn’	1
Hemmings	1
so	1
tartly	1
when	1
the	1
latter,	1
seeing	1
his	1
Chairman	1
seated	1
there,	1
entered	1
with	1
the	1
new	1
Superintendent’s	1
first	1
report,	1
that	1
the	1
Secretary	1
withdrew	1
with	1
regretful	1
dignity;	1
and	1
sending	1
for	1
the	1
transfer	1
clerk,	1
blew	1
him	1
up	1
till	1
the	1
poor	1
youth	1
knew	1
not	1
where	1
to	1
look.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
—	1
by	1
George	1
—	1
as	1
he	1
(Down-by-the-starn)	1
would	1
have	1
him	1
know,	1
for	1
a	1
whippersnapper	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
fellow	1
like	1
him,	1
to	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
that	1
office,	1
and	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
God	1
Almighty.	1
He	1
(Down-by-the-starn)	1
had	1
been	1
head	1
of	1
that	1
office	1
for	1
more	1
years	1
than	1
a	1
boy	1
like	1
him	1
could	1
count,	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
thought	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
all	1
his	1
work,	1
he	1
could	1
sit	1
there	1
doing	1
nothing,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
him,	1
Hemmings	1
(Down-by-the-starn),	1
and	1
so	1
forth.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
green	1
baize	1
door	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
sat	1
at	1
the	1
long,	1
mahogany-and-leather	1
board	1
table,	1
his	1
thick,	1
loose-jointed,	1
tortoiseshell	1
eye-glasses	1
perched	1
on	1
the	1
bridge	1
of	1
his	1
nose,	1
his	1
gold	1
pencil	1
moving	1
down	1
the	1
clauses	1
of	1
his	1
Will.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
simple	1
affair,	1
for	1
there	1
were	1
none	1
of	1
those	1
vexatious	1
little	1
legacies	1
and	1
donations	1
to	1
charities,	1
which	1
fritter	1
away	1
a	1
man’s	1
possessions,	1
and	1
damage	1
the	1
majestic	1
effect	1
of	1
that	1
little	1
paragraph	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
papers	1
accorded	1
to	1
Forsytes	1
who	1
die	1
with	1
a	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
pounds.	1
A	1
simple	1
affair.	1
Just	1
a	1
bequest	1
to	1
his	1
son	1
of	1
twenty	1
thousand,	1
and	1
‘as	1
to	1

Provided	1

’	1
and	1
so	1
on,	1
in	1
seven	1
folios	1
of	1
brief	1
and	1
simple	1
phraseology.	1
The	1
Will	1
had	1
been	1
drawn	1
by	1
James	1
in	1
his	1
palmy	1
days.	1
He	1
had	1
foreseen	1
almost	1
every	1
contingency.	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
sat	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
reading	1
this	1
Will;	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
took	1
half	1
a	1
sheet	1
of	1
paper	1
from	1
the	1
rack,	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
prolonged	1
pencil	1
note;	1
then	1
buttoning	1
up	1
the	1
Will,	1
he	1
caused	1
a	1
cab	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
and	1
drove	1
to	1
the	1
offices	1
of	1
Paramor	1
and	1
Herring,	1
in	1
Lincoln’s	1
Inn	1
Fields.	1
Jack	1
Herring	1
was	1
dead,	1
but	1
his	1
nephew	1
was	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
firm,	1
and	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
was	1
closeted	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
half	1
an	1
hour.	1
He	1
had	1
kept	1
the	1
hansom,	1
and	1
on	1
coming	1
out,	1
gave	1
the	1
driver	1
the	1
address	1
—	1
3,	1
Wistaria	1
Avenue.	1
He	1
felt	1
a	1
strange,	1
slow	1
satisfaction,	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
scored	1
a	1
victory	1
over	1
James	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
property.	1
They	1
should	1
not	1
poke	1
their	1
noses	1
into	1
his	1
affairs	1
any	1
more;	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
cancelled	1
their	1
trusteeships	1
of	1
his	1
Will;	1
he	1
would	1
take	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
his	1
business	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
hands,	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
young	1
Herring,	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
move	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
his	1
Companies	1
too.	1
If	1
that	1
young	1
Soames	1
were	1
such	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
property,	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
miss	1
a	1
thousand	1
a	1
year	1
or	1
so;	1
and	1
under	1
his	1
great	1
white	1
moustache	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
grimly	1
smiled.	1
He	1
felt	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
retributive	1
justice,	1
richly	1
deserved.	1
Slowly,	1
surely,	1
with	1
the	1
secret	1
inner	1
process	1
that	1
works	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
tree,	1
the	1
poison	1
of	1
the	1
wounds	1
to	1
his	1
happiness,	1
his	1
will,	1
his	1
pride,	1
had	1
corroded	1
the	1
comely	1
edifice	1
of	1
his	1
philosophy.	1
Life	1
had	1
worn	1
him	1
down	1
on	1
one	1
side,	1
till,	1
like	1
that	1
family	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
head,	1
he	1
had	1
lost	1
balance.	1
To	1
him,	1
borne	1
northwards	1
towards	1
his	1
son’s	1
house,	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
disposition	1
of	1
property,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
set	1
in	1
motion,	1
appeared	1
vaguely	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
a	1
stroke	1
of	1
punishment,	1
levelled	1
at	1
that	1
family	1
and	1
that	1
Society,	1
of	1
which	1
James	1
and	1
his	1
son	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
representatives.	1
He	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
restitution	1
to	1
young	1
Jolyon,	1
and	1
restitution	1
to	1
young	1
Jolyon	1
satisfied	1
his	1
secret	1
craving	1
for	1
revenge-revenge	1
against	1
Time,	1
sorrow,	1
and	1
interference,	1
against	1
all	1
that	1
incalculable	1
sum	1
of	1
disapproval	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
bestowed	1
by	1
the	1
world	1
for	1
fifteen	1
years	1
on	1
his	1
only	1
son.	1
It	1
presented	1
itself	1
as	1
the	1
one	1
possible	1
way	1
of	1
asserting	1
once	1
more	1
the	1
domination	1
of	1
his	1
will;	1
of	1
forcing	1
James,	1
and	1
Soames,	1
and	1
the	1
family,	1
and	1
all	1
those	1
hidden	1
masses	1
of	1
Forsytes	1
—	1
a	1
great	1
stream	1
rolling	1
against	1
the	1
single	1
dam	1
of	1
his	1
obstinacy	1
—	1
to	1
recognise	1
once	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
master.	1
It	1
was	1
sweet	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
boy	1
a	1
richer	1
man	1
by	1
far	1
than	1
that	1
son	1
of	1
James,	1
that	1
‘man	1
of	1
property.’	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
sweet	1
to	1
give	1
to	1
Jo,	1
for	1
he	1
loved	1
his	1
son.	1
Neither	1
young	1
Jolyon	1
nor	1
his	1
wife	1
were	1
in	1
(young	1
Jolyon	1
indeed	1
was	1
not	1
back	1
from	1
the	1
Botanical),	1
but	1
the	1
little	1
maid	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
expected	1
the	1
master	1
at	1
any	1
moment:	1
“He’s	1
always	1
at	1
‘ome	1
to	1
tea,	1
sir,	1
to	1
play	1
with	1
the	1
children.”	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
said	1
he	1
would	1
wait;	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
patiently	1
enough	1
in	1
the	1
faded,	1
shabby	1
drawing	1
room,	1
where,	1
now	1
that	1
the	1
summer	1
chintzes	1
were	1
removed,	1
the	1
old	1
chairs	1
and	1
sofas	1
revealed	1
all	1
their	1
threadbare	1
deficiencies.	1
He	1
longed	1
to	1
send	1
for	1
the	1
children;	1
to	1
have	1
them	1
there	1
beside	1
him,	1
their	1
supple	1
bodies	1
against	1
his	1
knees;	1
to	1
hear	1
Jolly’s:	1
“Hallo,	1
Gran!”	1
and	1
see	1
his	1
rush;	1
and	1
feel	1
Holly’s	1
soft	1
little	1
hand	1
stealing	1
up	1
against	1
his	1
cheek.	1
But	1
he	1
would	1
not.	1
There	1
was	1
solemnity	1
in	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
do,	1
and	1
until	1
it	1
was	1
over	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
play.	1
He	1
amused	1
himself	1
by	1
thinking	1
how	1
with	1
two	1
strokes	1
of	1
his	1
pen	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
restore	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
caste	1
so	1
conspicuously	1
absent	1
from	1
everything	1
in	1
that	1
little	1
house;	1
how	1
he	1
could	1
fill	1
these	1
rooms,	1
or	1
others	1
in	1
some	1
larger	1
mansion,	1
with	1
triumphs	1
of	1
art	1
from	1
Baple	1
and	1
Pullbred’s;	1
how	1
he	1
could	1
send	1
little	1
Jolly	1
to	1
Harrow	1
and	1
Oxford	1
(he	1
no	1
longer	1
had	1
faith	1
in	1
Eton	1
and	1
Cambridge,	1
for	1
his	1
son	1
had	1
been	1
there);	1
how	1
he	1
could	1
procure	1
little	1
Holly	1
the	1
best	1
musical	1
instruction,	1
the	1
child	1
had	1
a	1
remarkable	1
aptitude.	1
As	1
these	1
visions	1
crowded	1
before	1
him,	1
causing	1
emotion	1
to	1
swell	1
his	1
heart,	1
he	1
rose,	1
and	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
window,	1
looking	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
little	1
walled	1
strip	1
of	1
garden,	1
where	1
the	1
pear-tree,	1
bare	1
of	1
leaves	1
before	1
its	1
time,	1
stood	1
with	1
gaunt	1
branches	1
in	1
the	1
slow-gathering	1
mist	1
of	1
the	1
autumn	1
afternoon.	1
The	1
dog	1
Balthasar,	1
his	1
tail	1
curled	1
tightly	1
over	1
a	1
piebald,	1
furry	1
back,	1
was	1
walking	1
at	1
the	1
farther	1
end,	1
sniffing	1
at	1
the	1
plants,	1
and	1
at	1
intervals	1
placing	1
his	1
leg	1
for	1
support	1
against	1
the	1
wall.	1
And	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
mused.	1
What	1
pleasure	1
was	1
there	1
left	1
but	1
to	1
give?	1
It	1
was	1
pleasant	1
to	1
give,	1
when	1
you	1
could	1
find	1
one	1
who	1
would	1
be	1
thankful	1
for	1
what	1
you	1
gave	1
—	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood!	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
such	1
satisfaction	1
to	1
be	1
had	1
out	1
of	1
giving	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
belong	1
to	1
you,	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
no	1
claim	1
on	1
you!	1
Such	1
giving	1
as	1
that	1
was	1
a	1
betrayal	1
of	1
the	1
individualistic	1
convictions	1
and	1
actions	1
of	1
his	1
life,	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
enterprise,	1
his	1
labour,	1
and	1
his	1
moderation,	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
proud	1
fact	1
that,	1
like	1
tens	1
of	1
thousands	1
of	1
Forsytes	1
before	1
him,	1
tens	1
of	1
thousands	1
in	1
the	1
present,	1
tens	1
of	1
thousands	1
in	1
the	1
future,	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
made	1
his	1
own,	1
and	1
held	1
his	1
own,	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
And,	1
while	1
he	1
stood	1
there	1
looking	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
smut-covered	1
foliage	1
of	1
the	1
laurels,	1
the	1
black-stained	1
grass-plot,	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
the	1
dog	1
Balthasar,	1
all	1
the	1
suffering	1
of	1
the	1
fifteen	1
years	1
during	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
baulked	1
of	1
legitimate	1
enjoyment	1
mingled	1
its	1
gall	1
with	1
the	1
sweetness	1
of	1
the	1
approaching	1
moment.	1
Young	1
Jolyon	1
came	1
at	1
last,	1
pleased	1
with	1
his	1
work,	1
and	1
fresh	1
from	1
long	1
hours	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
air.	1
On	1
hearing	1
that	1
his	1
father	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
drawing	1
room,	1
he	1
inquired	1
hurriedly	1
whether	1
Mrs.	1
Forsyte	1
was	1
at	1
home,	1
and	1
being	1
informed	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not,	1
heaved	1
a	1
sigh	1
of	1
relief.	1
Then	1
putting	1
his	1
painting	1
materials	1
carefully	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
coat-closet	1
out	1
of	1
sight,	1
he	1
went	1
in.	1
With	1
characteristic	1
decision	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
came	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
the	1
point.	1
“I’ve	1
been	1
altering	1
my	1
arrangements,	1
Jo,”	1
he	1
said.	1
“You	1
can	1
cut	1
your	1
coat	1
a	1
bit	1
longer	1
in	1
the	1
future	1
—	1
I’m	1
settling	1
a	1
thousand	1
a	1
year	1
on	1
you	1
at	1
once.	1
June	1
will	1
have	1
fifty	1
thousand	1
at	1
my	1
death;	1
and	1
you	1
the	1
rest.	1
That	1
dog	1
of	1
yours	1
is	1
spoiling	1
the	1
garden.	1
I	1
shouldn’t	1
keep	1
a	1
dog,	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
you!”	1
The	1
dog	1
Balthasar,	1
seated	1
in	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
lawn,	1
was	1
examining	1
his	1
tail.	1
Young	1
Jolyon	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
animal,	1
but	1
saw	1
him	1
dimly,	1
for	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
misty.	1
“Yours	1
won’t	1
come	1
short	1
of	1
a	1
hundred	1
thousand,	1
my	1
boy,”	1
said	1
old	1
Jolyon;	1
“I	1
thought	1
you’d	1
better	1
know.	1
I	1
haven’t	1
much	1
longer	1
to	1
live	1
at	1
my	1
age.	1
I	1
shan’t	1
allude	1
to	1
it	1
again.	1
How’s	1
your	1
wife?	1
And	1
—	1
give	1
her	1
my	1
love.”	1
Young	1
Jolyon	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
on	1
his	1
father’s	1
shoulder,	1
and,	1
as	1
neither	1
spoke,	1
the	1
episode	1
closed.	1
Having	1
seen	1
his	1
father	1
into	1
a	1
hansom,	1
young	1
Jolyon	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
and	1
stood,	1
where	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
had	1
stood,	1
looking	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
little	1
garden.	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
realize	1
all	1
that	1
this	1
meant	1
to	1
him,	1
and,	1
Forsyte	1
that	1
he	1
was,	1
vistas	1
of	1
property	1
were	1
opened	1
out	1
in	1
his	1
brain;	1
the	1
years	1
of	1
half	1
rations	1
through	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
passed	1
had	1
not	1
sapped	1
his	1
natural	1
instincts.	1
In	1
extremely	1
practical	1
form,	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
travel,	1
of	1
his	1
wife’s	1
costume,	1
the	1
children’s	1
education,	1
a	1
pony	1
for	1
Jolly,	1
a	1
thousand	1
things;	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
thought,	1
too,	1
of	1
Bosinney	1
and	1
his	1
mistress,	1
and	1
the	1
broken	1
song	1
of	1
the	1
thrush.	1
Joy	1
—	1
tragedy!	1
Which?	2
The	1
old	1
past	1
—	1
the	1
poignant,	1
suffering,	1
passionate,	1
wonderful	1
past,	1
that	1
no	1
money	1
could	1
buy,	1
that	1
nothing	1
could	1
restore	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
burning	1
sweetness	1
—	1
had	1
come	1
back	1
before	1
him.	1
When	1
his	1
wife	1
came	1
in	1
he	1
went	1
straight	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
took	1
her	1
in	1
his	1
arms;	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
he	1
stood	1
without	1
speaking,	1
his	1
eyes	1
closed,	1
pressing	1
her	1
to	1
him,	1
while	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
wondering,	1
adoring,	1
doubting	1
look	1
in	1
her	1
eyes.	1
Chapter	1
27	1
Voyage	1
into	1
the	1
Inferno	1
The	1
morning	1
after	1
a	1
certain	1
night	1
on	1
which	1
Soames	1
at	1
last	1
asserted	1
his	1
rights	1
and	1
acted	1
like	1
a	1
man,	1
he	1
breakfasted	1
alone.	1
He	1
breakfasted	1
by	1
gaslight,	1
the	1
fog	1
of	1
late	1
November	1
wrapping	1
the	1
town	1
as	1
in	1
some	1
monstrous	1
blanket	1
till	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
the	1
Square	1
even	1
were	1
barely	1
visible	1
from	1
the	1
dining-room	1
window.	1
He	1
ate	1
steadily,	1
but	1
at	1
times	1
a	1
sensation	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
swallow	1
attacked	1
him.	1
Had	1
he	1
been	1
right	1
to	1
yield	1
to	1
his	1
overmastering	1
hunger	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
before,	1
and	1
break	1
down	1
the	1
resistance	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
suffered	1
now	1
too	1
long	1
from	1
this	1
woman	1
who	1
was	1
his	1
lawful	1
and	1
solemnly	1
constituted	1
helpmate?	1
He	1
was	1
strangely	1
haunted	1
by	1
the	1
recollection	1
of	1
her	1
face,	1
from	1
before	1
which,	1
to	1
soothe	1
her,	1
he	1
had	1
tried	1
to	1
pull	1
her	1
hands	1
—	1
of	1
her	1
terrible	1
smothered	1
sobbing,	1
the	1
like	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
heard,	1
and	1
still	1
seemed	1
to	1
hear;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
still	1
haunted	1
by	1
the	1
odd,	1
intolerable	1
feeling	1
of	1
remorse	1
and	1
shame	1
he	1
had	1
felt,	1
as	1
he	1
stood	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
flame	1
of	1
the	1
single	1
candle,	1
before	1
silently	1
slinking	1
away.	1
And	1
somehow,	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
acted	1
like	1
this,	1
he	1
was	1
surprised	1
at	1
himself.	1
Two	1
nights	1
before,	1
at	1
Winifred	1
Dartie’s,	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
Mrs.	1
MacAnder	1
into	1
dinner.	1
She	1
had	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
looking	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
her	1
sharp,	1
greenish	1
eyes:	1
“And	1
so	1
your	1
wife	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
friend	1
of	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Bosinney’s?”	1
Not	1
deigning	1
to	1
ask	1
what	1
she	1
meant,	1
he	1
had	1
brooded	1
over	1
her	1
words.	1
They	1
had	1
roused	1
in	1
him	1
a	1
fierce	1
jealousy,	1
which,	1
with	1
the	1
peculiar	1
perversion	1
of	1
this	1
instinct,	1
had	1
turned	1
to	1
fiercer	1
desire.	1
Without	1
the	1
incentive	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
MacAnder’s	1
words	1
he	1
might	1
never	1
have	1
done	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
done.	1
Without	1
their	1
incentive	1
and	1
the	1
accident	1
of	1
finding	1
his	1
wife’s	1
door	1
for	1
once	1
unlocked,	1
which	1
had	1
enabled	1
him	1
to	1
steal	1
upon	1
her	1
asleep.	1
Slumber	1
had	1
removed	1
his	1
doubts,	1
but	1
the	1
morning	1
brought	1
them	1
again.	1
One	1
thought	1
comforted	1
him:	1
No	1
one	1
would	1
know	1
—	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
thing	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
speak	1
about.	1
And,	1
indeed,	1
when	1
the	1
vehicle	1
of	1
his	1
daily	1
business	1
life,	1
which	1
needed	1
so	1
imperatively	1
the	1
grease	1
of	1
clear	1
and	1
practical	1
thought,	1
started	1
rolling	1
once	1
more	1
with	1
the	1
reading	1
of	1
his	1
letters,	1
those	1
nightmare-like	1
doubts	1
began	1
to	1
assume	1
less	1
extravagant	1
importance	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
his	1
mind.	1
The	1
incident	1
was	1
really	1
not	1
of	1
great	1
moment;	1
women	1
made	1
a	1
fuss	1
about	1
it	1
in	1
books;	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
cool	1
judgment	1
of	1
right-thinking	1
men,	1
of	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
of	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
recollected	1
often	1
received	1
praise	1
in	1
the	1
Divorce	1
Court,	1
he	1
had	1
but	1
done	1
his	1
best	1
to	1
sustain	1
the	1
sanctity	1
of	1
marriage,	1
to	1
prevent	1
her	1
from	1
abandoning	1
her	1
duty,	1
possibly,	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
still	1
seeing	1
Bosinney,	1
from.	1
.	3
No,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
regret	1
it.	1
Now	1
that	1
the	1
first	1
step	1
towards	1
reconciliation	1
had	1
been	1
taken,	1
the	1
rest	1
would	1
be	1
comparatively	1
—	1
comparatively.	1
.	3
He,	1
rose	1
and	1
walked	1
to	1
the	1
window.	1
His	1
nerve	1
had	1
been	1
shaken.	1
The	1
sound	1
of	1
smothered	1
sobbing	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
ears	1
again.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
it.	1
He	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
fur	1
coat,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
fog;	1
having	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
City,	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
underground	1
railway	1
from	1
Sloane	1
Square	1
station.	1
In	1
his	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
first-class	1
compartment	1
filled	1
with	1
City	1
men	1
the	1
smothered	1
sobbing	1
still	1
haunted	1
him,	1
so	1
he	1
opened	1
the	1
Times	1
with	1
the	1
rich	1
crackle	1
that	1
drowns	1
all	1
lesser	1
sounds,	1
and,	1
barricaded	1
behind	1
it,	1
set	1
himself	1
steadily	1
to	1
con	1
the	1
news.	1
He	1
read	1
that	1
a	1
Recorder	1
had	1
charged	1
a	1
grand	1
jury	1
on	1
the	1
previous	1
day	1
with	1
a	1
more	1
than	1
usually	1
long	1
list	1
of	1
offences.	1
He	1
read	1
of	1
three	1
murders,	1
five	1
manslaughters,	1
seven	1
arsons,	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
eleven	1
rapes	1
—	1
a	1
surprisingly	1
high	1
number	1
—	1
in	1
addition	1
to	1
many	1
less	1
conspicuous	1
crimes,	1
to	1
be	1
tried	1
during	1
a	1
coming	1
Sessions;	1
and	1
from	1
one	1
piece	1
of	1
news	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
another,	1
keeping	1
the	1
paper	1
well	1
before	1
his	1
face.	1
And	1
still,	1
inseparable	1
from	1
his	1
reading,	1
was	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
Irene’s	1
tear-stained	1
face,	1
and	1
the	1
sounds	1
from	1
her	1
broken	1
heart.	1
The	1
day	1
was	1
a	1
busy	1
one,	1
including,	1
in	1
addition	1
to	1
the	1
ordinary	1
affairs	1
of	1
his	1
practice,	1
a	1
visit	1
to	1
his	1
brokers,	1
Messrs.	1
Grin	1
and	1
Grinning,	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
instructions	1
to	1
sell	1
his	1
shares	1
in	1
the	1
New	1
Colliery	1
Co.,	1
Ltd.,	1
whose	1
business	1
he	1
suspected,	1
rather	1
than	1
knew,	1
was	1
stagnating	1
(this	1
enterprise	1
afterwards	1
slowly	1
declined,	1
and	1
was	1
ultimately	1
sold	1
for	1
a	1
song	1
to	1
an	1
American	1
syndicate);	1
and	1
a	1
long	1
conference	1
at	1
Waterbuck,	1
Q.C.‘s	1
chambers,	1
attended	1
by	1
Boulter,	1
by	1
Fiske,	1
the	1
junior	1
counsel,	1
and	1
Waterbuck,	1
Q.C.,	1
himself.	1
The	1
case	1
of	1
Forsyte	1
v.	1
Bosinney	1
was	1
expected	1
to	1
be	1
reached	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
before	1
Mr.	1
Justice	1
Bentham.	1
Mr.	1
Justice	1
Bentham,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
common-sense	1
rather	1
than	1
too	1
great	1
legal	1
knowledge,	1
was	1
considered	1
to	1
be	1
about	1
the	1
best	1
man	1
they	1
could	1
have	1
to	1
try	1
the	1
action.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
‘strong’	1
Judge.	1
Waterbuck,	1
Q.C.,	1
in	1
pleasing	1
conjunction	1
with	1
an	1
almost	1
rude	1
neglect	1
of	1
Boulter	1
and	1
Fiske	1
paid	1
to	1
Soames	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
of	1
attention,	1
by	1
instinct	1
or	1
the	1
sounder	1
evidence	1
of	1
rumour,	1
feeling	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
property.	1
He	1
held	1
with	1
remarkable	1
consistency	1
to	1
the	1
opinion	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
expressed	1
in	1
writing,	1
that	1
the	1
issue	1
would	1
depend	1
to	1
a	1
great	1
extent	1
on	1
the	1
evidence	1
given	1
at	1
the	1
trial,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
well	1
directed	1
remarks	1
he	1
advised	1
Soames	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
too	1
careful	1
in	1
giving	1
that	1
evidence.	1
“A	1
little	1
bluffness,	1
Mr.	1
Forsyte,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“a	1
little	1
bluffness,”	1
and	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
he	1
laughed	1
firmly,	1
closed	1
his	1
lips	1
tight,	1
and	1
scratched	1
his	1
head	1
just	1
below	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
pushed	1
his	1
wig	1
back,	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
like	1
the	1
gentleman-farmer	1
for	1
whom	1
he	1
loved	1
to	1
be	1
taken.	1
He	1
was	1
considered	1
perhaps	1
the	1
leading	1
man	1
in	1
breach	1
of	1
promise	1
cases.	1
Soames	1
used	1
the	1
underground	1
again	1
in	1
going	1
home.	1
The	1
fog	1
was	1
worse	1
than	1
ever	1
at	1
Sloane	1
Square	1
station.	1
Through	1
the	1
still,	1
thick	1
blur,	1
men	1
groped	1
in	1
and	1
out;	1
women,	1
very	1
few,	1
grasped	1
their	1
reticules	1
to	1
their	1
bosoms	1
and	1
handkerchiefs	1
to	1
their	1
mouths;	1
crowned	1
with	1
the	1
weird	1
excrescence	1
of	1
the	1
driver,	1
haloed	1
by	1
a	1
vague	1
glow	1
of	1
lamp-light	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
drown	1
in	1
vapour	1
before	1
it	1
reached	1
the	1
pavement,	1
cabs	1
loomed	1
dim-shaped	1
ever	1
and	1
again,	1
and	1
discharged	1
citizens,	1
bolting	1
like	1
rabbits	1
to	1
their	1
burrows.	1
And	1
these	1
shadowy	1
figures,	1
wrapped	1
each	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
little	1
shroud	1
of	1
fog,	1
took	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
each	1
other.	1
In	1
the	1
great	1
warren,	1
each	1
rabbit	1
for	1
himself,	1
especially	1
those	1
clothed	1
in	1
the	1
more	1
expensive	1
fur,	1
who,	1
afraid	1
of	1
carriages	1
on	1
foggy	1
days,	1
are	1
driven	1
underground.	1
One	1
figure,	1
however,	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
Soames,	1
waited	1
at	1
the	1
station	1
door.	1
Some	1
buccaneer	1
or	1
lover,	1
of	1
whom	1
each	1
Forsyte	1
thought:	1
‘Poor	1
devil!	1
looks	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
having	1
a	1
bad	1
time!’	1
Their	1
kind	1
hearts	1
beat	1
a	1
stroke	1
faster	1
for	1
that	1
poor,	1
waiting,	1
anxious	1
lover	1
in	1
the	1
fog;	1
but	1
they	1
hurried	1
by,	1
well	1
knowing	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
neither	1
time	1
nor	1
money	1
to	1
spare	1
for	1
any	1
suffering	1
but	1
their	1
own.	1
Only	1
a	1
policeman,	1
patrolling	1
slowly	1
and	1
at	1
intervals,	1
took	1
an	1
interest	1
in	1
that	1
waiting	1
figure,	1
the	1
brim	1
of	1
whose	1
slouch	1
hat	1
half	1
hid	1
a	1
face	1
reddened	1
by	1
the	1
cold,	1
all	1
thin,	1
and	1
haggard,	1
over	1
which	1
a	1
hand	1
stole	1
now	1
and	1
again	1
to	1
smooth	1
away	1
anxiety,	1
or	1
renew	1
the	1
resolution	1
that	1
kept	1
him	1
waiting	1
there.	1
But	1
the	1
waiting	1
lover	1
(if	1
lover	1
he	1
were)	1
was	1
used	1
to	1
policemen’s	1
scrutiny,	1
or	1
too	1
absorbed	1
in	1
his	1
anxiety,	1
for	1
he	1
never	1
flinched.	1
A	1
hardened	1
case,	1
accustomed	1
to	1
long	1
trysts,	1
to	1
anxiety,	1
and	1
fog,	1
and	1
cold,	1
if	1
only	1
his	1
mistress	1
came	1
at	1
last.	1
Foolish	1
lover!	1
Fogs	1
last	1
until	1
the	1
spring;	1
there	1
is	1
also	1
snow	1
and	1
rain,	1
no	1
comfort	1
anywhere;	1
gnawing	1
fear	1
if	1
you	1
bring	1
her	1
out,	1
gnawing	1
fear	1
if	1
you	1
bid	1
her	1
stay	1
at	1
home!	1
“Serve	1
him	1
right;	1
he	1
should	1
arrange	1
his	1
affairs	1
better!”	1
So	1
any	1
respectable	1
Forsyte.	1
Yet,	1
if	1
that	1
sounder	1
citizen	1
could	1
have	1
listened	1
at	1
the	1
waiting	1
lover’s	1
heart,	1
out	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
fog	1
and	1
the	1
cold,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
again:	1
“Yes,	1
poor	1
devil	1
he’s	1
having	1
a	1
bad	1
time!”	1
Soames	1
got	1
into	1
his	1
cab,	1
and,	1
with	1
the	1
glass	1
down,	1
crept	1
along	1
Sloane	1
Street,	1
and	1
so	1
along	1
the	1
Brompton	1
Road,	1
and	1
home.	1
He	1
reached	1
his	1
house	1
at	1
five.	1
His	1
wife	1
was	1
not	1
in.	1
She	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
before.	1
Out	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
time	1
of	1
night,	1
into	1
this	1
terrible	1
fog!	1
What	1
was	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
that?	1
He	1
sat	1
by	1
the	1
dining-room	1
fire,	1
with	1
the	1
door	1
open,	1
disturbed	1
to	1
the	1
soul,	1
trying	1
to	1
read	1
the	1
evening	1
paper.	1
A	1
book	1
was	1
no	1
good	1
—	1
in	1
daily	1
papers	1
alone	1
was	1
any	1
narcotic	1
to	1
such	1
worry	1
as	1
his.	1
From	1
the	1
customary	1
events	1
recorded	1
in	1
the	1
journal	1
he	1
drew	1
some	1
comfort.	1
‘Suicide	1
of	1
an	1
actress’—‘Grave	1
indisposition	1
of	1
a	1
Statesman’	1
(that	1
chronic	1
sufferer)—‘Divorce	1
of	1
an	1
army	1
officer’—‘Fire	1
in	1
a	1
colliery’—	1
he	1
read	1
them	1
all.	1
They	1
helped	1
him	1
a	1
little	1
—	1
prescribed	1
by	1
the	1
greatest	1
of	1
all	1
doctors,	1
our	1
natural	1
taste.	1
It	1
was	1
nearly	1
seven	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
her	1
come	1
in.	1
The	1
incident	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
had	1
long	1
lost	1
its	1
importance	1
under	1
stress	1
of	1
anxiety	1
at	1
her	1
strange	1
sortie	1
into	1
the	1
fog.	1
But	1
now	1
that	1
Irene	1
was	1
home,	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
her	1
broken-hearted	1
sobbing	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
nervous	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
facing	1
her.	1
She	1
was	1
already	1
on	1
the	1
stairs;	1
her	1
grey	1
fur	1
coat	1
hung	1
to	1
her	1
knees,	1
its	1
high	1
collar	1
almost	1
hid	1
her	1
face,	1
she	1
wore	1
a	1
thick	1
veil.	1
She	1
neither	1
turned	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
him	1
nor	1
spoke.	1
No	1
ghost	1
or	1
stranger	1
could	1
have	1
passed	1
more	1
silently.	1
Bilson	1
came	1
to	1
lay	1
dinner,	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
Mrs.	1
Forsyte	1
was	1
not	1
coming	1
down;	1
she	1
was	1
having	1
the	1
soup	1
in	1
her	1
room.	1
For	1
once	1
Soames	1
did	1
not	1
‘change’;	1
it	1
was,	1
perhaps,	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
in	1
his	1
life	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
dinner	1
with	1
soiled	1
cuffs,	1
and,	1
not	1
even	1
noticing	1
them,	1
he	1
brooded	1
long	1
over	1
his	1
wine.	1
He	1
sent	1
Bilson	1
to	1
light	1
a	1
fire	1
in	1
his	1
picture-room,	1
and	1
presently	1
went	1
up	1
there	1
himself.	1
Turning	1
on	1
the	1
gas,	1
he	1
heaved	1
a	1
deep	1
sigh,	1
as	1
though	1
amongst	1
these	1
treasures,	1
the	1
backs	1
of	1
which	1
confronted	1
him	1
in	1
stacks,	1
around	1
the	1
little	1
room,	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
at	1
length	1
his	1
peace	1
of	1
mind.	1
He	1
went	1
straight	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
greatest	1
treasure	1
of	1
them	1
all,	1
an	1
undoubted	1
Turner,	1
and,	1
carrying	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
easel,	1
turned	1
its	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
light.	1
There	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
movement	1
in	1
Turners,	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
part	1
with	1
it.	1
He	1
stood	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
his	1
pale,	1
clean-shaven	1
face	1
poked	1
forward	1
above	1
his	1
stand-up	1
collar,	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
picture	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
adding	1
it	1
up;	1
a	1
wistful	1
expression	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
eyes;	1
he	1
found,	1
perhaps,	1
that	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
too	1
little.	1
He	1
took	1
it	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
easel	1
to	1
put	1
it	1
back	1
against	1
the	1
wall;	1
but,	1
in	1
crossing	1
the	1
room,	1
stopped,	1
for	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
hear	1
sobbing.	1
It	1
was	1
nothing	1
—	1
only	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
thing	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
bothering	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
morning.	1
And	1
soon	1
after,	1
putting	1
the	1
high	1
guard	1
before	1
the	1
blazing	1
fire,	1
he	1
stole	1
downstairs.	1
Fresh	1
for	1
the	1
morrow!	1
was	1
his	1
thought.	1
It	1
was	1
long	1
before	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
sleep.	1
.	3
It	1
is	1
now	1
to	1
George	1
Forsyte	1
that	1
the	1
mind	1
must	1
turn	1
for	1
light	1
on	1
the	1
events	1
of	1
that	1
fog-engulfed	1
afternoon.	1
The	1
wittiest	1
and	1
most	1
sportsmanlike	1
of	1
the	1
Forsytes	1
had	1
passed	1
the	1
day	1
reading	1
a	1
novel	1
in	1
the	1
paternal	1
mansion	1
at	1
Princes’	1
Gardens.	1
Since	1
a	1
recent	1
crisis	1
in	1
his	1
financial	1
affairs	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
kept	1
on	1
parole	1
by	1
Roger,	1
and	1
compelled	1
to	1
reside	1
‘at	1
home.’	1
Towards	1
five	1
o’clock	1
he	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
took	1
train	1
at	1
South	1
Kensington	1
Station	1
(for	1
everyone	1
to-day	1
went	1
Underground).	1
His	1
intention	1
was	1
to	1
dine,	1
and	1
pass	1
the	1
evening	1
playing	1
billiards	1
at	1
the	1
Red	1
Pottle	1
—	1
that	1
unique	1
hostel,	1
neither	1
club,	1
hotel,	1
nor	1
good	1
gilt	1
restaurant.	1
He	1
got	1
out	1
at	1
Charing	1
Cross,	1
choosing	1
it	1
in	1
preference	1
to	1
his	1
more	1
usual	1
St.	1
James’s	1
Park,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
reach	1
Jermyn	1
Street	1
by	1
better	1
lighted	1
ways.	1
On	1
the	1
platform	1
his	1
eyes	1
—	1
for	1
in	1
combination	1
with	1
a	1
composed	1
and	1
fashionable	1
appearance,	1
George	1
had	1
sharp	1
eyes,	1
and	1
was	1
always	1
on	1
the	1
look-out	1
for	1
fillips	1
to	1
his	1
sardonic	1
humour	1
—	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
attracted	1
by	1
a	1
man,	1
who,	1
leaping	1
from	1
a	1
first-class	1
compartment,	1
staggered	1
rather	1
than	1
walked	1
towards	1
the	1
exit.	1
‘So	1
ho,	1
my	1
bird!’	1
said	1
George	1
to	1
himself;	1
‘why,	1
it’s	1
“the	1
Buccaneer!”’	1
and	1
he	1
put	1
his	1
big	1
figure	1
on	1
the	1
trail.	1
Nothing	1
afforded	1
him	1
greater	1
amusement	1
than	1
a	1
drunken	1
man.	1
Bosinney,	1
who	1
wore	1
a	1
slouch	1
hat,	1
stopped	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him,	1
spun	1
around,	1
and	1
rushed	1
back	1
towards	1
the	1
carriage	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
left.	1
He	1
was	1
too	1
late.	1
A	1
porter	1
caught	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
coat;	1
the	1
train	1
was	1
already	1
moving	1
on.	1
George’s	1
practised	1
glance	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
lady	1
clad	1
in	1
a	1
grey	1
fur	1
coat	1
at	1
the	1
carriage	1
window.	1
It	1
was	1
Mrs.	1
Soames	1
—	1
and	1
George	1
felt	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
interesting!	1
And	1
now	1
he	1
followed	1
Bosinney	1
more	1
closely	1
than	1
ever	1
—	1
up	1
the	1
stairs,	1
past	1
the	1
ticket	1
collector	1
into	1
the	1
street.	1
In	1
that	1
progress,	1
however,	1
his	1
feelings	1
underwent	1
a	1
change;	1
no	1
longer	1
merely	1
curious	1
and	1
amused,	1
he	1
felt	1
sorry	1
for	1
the	1
poor	1
fellow	1
he	1
was	1
shadowing.	1
‘The	1
Buccaneer’	1
was	1
not	1
drunk,	1
but	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
acting	1
under	1
the	1
stress	1
of	1
violent	1
emotion;	1
he	1
was	1
talking	1
to	1
himself,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
George	1
could	1
catch	1
were	1
the	1
words	1
“Oh,	1
God!”	1
Nor	1
did	1
he	1
appear	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
doing,	1
or	1
where	1
going;	1
but	1
stared,	1
hesitated,	1
moved	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mind;	1
and	1
from	1
being	1
merely	1
a	1
joker	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
amusement,	1
George	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
see	1
the	1
poor	1
chap	1
through.	1
He	1
had	1
‘taken	1
the	1
knock’—‘taken	1
the	1
knock!’	1
And	1
he	1
wondered	1
what	1
on	1
earth	1
Mrs.	1
Soames	1
had	1
been	1
saying,	1
what	1
on	1
earth	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
telling	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
railway	1
carriage.	1
She	1
had	1
looked	1
bad	1
enough	1
herself!	1
It	1
made	1
George	1
sorry	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
her	1
travelling	1
on	1
with	1
her	1
trouble	1
all	1
alone.	1
He	1
followed	1
close	1
behind	1
Bosinney’s	1
elbow	1
—	1
tall,	1
burly	1
figure,	1
saying	1
nothing,	1
dodging	1
warily	1
—	1
and	1
shadowed	1
him	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
fog.	1
There	1
was	1
something	1
here	1
beyond	1
a	1
jest!	1
He	1
kept	1
his	1
head	1
admirably,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
some	1
excitement,	1
for	1
in	1
addition	1
to	1
compassion,	1
the	1
instincts	1
of	1
the	1
chase	1
were	1
roused	1
within	1
him.	1
Bosinney	1
walked	1
right	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
thoroughfare	1
—	1
a	1
vast	1
muffled	1
blackness,	1
where	1
a	1
man	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
six	1
paces	1
before	1
him;	1
where,	1
all	1
around,	1
voices	1
or	1
whistles	1
mocked	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
direction;	1
and	1
sudden	1
shapes	1
came	1
rolling	1
slow	1
upon	1
them;	1
and	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
a	1
light	1
showed	1
like	1
a	1
dim	1
island	1
in	1
an	1
infinite	1
dark	1
sea.	1
And	1
fast	1
into	1
this	1
perilous	1
gulf	1
of	1
night	1
walked	1
Bosinney,	1
and	1
fast	1
after	1
him	1
walked	1
George.	1
If	1
the	1
fellow	1
meant	1
to	1
put	1
his	1
‘twopenny’	1
under	1
a	1
‘bus,	1
he	1
would	1
stop	1
it	1
if	1
he	1
could!	1
Across	1
the	1
street	1
and	1
back	1
the	1
hunted	1
creature	1
strode,	1
not	1
groping	1
as	1
other	1
men	1
were	1
groping	1
in	1
that	1
gloom,	1
but	1
driven	1
forward	1
as	1
though	1
the	1
faithful	1
George	1
behind	1
wielded	1
a	1
knout;	1
and	1
this	1
chase	1
after	1
a	1
haunted	1
man	1
began	1
to	1
have	1
for	1
George	1
the	1
strangest	1
fascination.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
that	1
the	1
affair	1
developed	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
which	1
ever	1
afterwards	1
caused	1
it	1
to	1
remain	1
green	1
in	1
his	1
mind.	1
Brought	1
to	1
a	1
stand-still	1
in	1
the	1
fog,	1
he	1
heard	1
words	1
which	1
threw	1
a	1
sudden	1
light	1
on	1
these	1
proceedings.	1
What	1
Mrs.	1
Soames	1
had	1
said	1
to	1
Bosinney	1
in	1
the	1
train	1
was	1
now	1
no	1
longer	1
dark.	1
George	1
understood	1
from	1
those	1
mutterings	1
that	1
Soames	1
had	1
exercised	1
his	1
rights	1
over	1
an	1
estranged	1
and	1
unwilling	1
wife	1
in	1
the	1
greatest	1
—	1
the	1
supreme	1
act	1
of	1
property.	1
His	1
fancy	1
wandered	1
in	1
the	1
fields	1
of	1
this	1
situation;	1
it	1
impressed	1
him;	1
he	1
guessed	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
anguish,	1
the	1
sexual	1
confusion	1
and	1
horror	1
in	1
Bosinney’s	1
heart.	1
And	1
he	1
thought:	1
‘Yes,	1
it’s	1
a	1
bit	1
thick!	1
I	1
don’t	1
wonder	1
the	1
poor	1
fellow	1
is	1
half-cracked!’	1
He	1
had	1
run	1
his	1
quarry	1
to	1
earth	1
on	1
a	1
bench	1
under	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
lions	1
in	1
Trafalgar	1
Square,	1
a	1
monster	1
sphynx	1
astray	1
like	1
themselves	1
in	1
that	1
gulf	1
of	1
darkness.	1
Here,	1
rigid	1
and	1
silent,	1
sat	1
Bosinney,	1
and	1
George,	1
in	1
whose	1
patience	1
was	1
a	1
touch	1
of	1
strange	1
brotherliness,	1
took	1
his	1
stand	1
behind.	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
lacking	1
in	1
a	1
certain	1
delicacy	1
—	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
form	1
—	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
permit	1
him	1
to	1
intrude	1
upon	1
this	1
tragedy,	1
and	1
he	1
waited,	1
quiet	1
as	1
the	1
lion	1
above,	1
his	1
fur	1
collar	1
hitched	1
above	1
his	1
ears	1
concealing	1
the	1
fleshy	1
redness	1
of	1
his	1
cheeks,	1
concealing	1
all	1
but	1
his	1
eyes	1
with	1
their	1
sardonic,	1
compassionate	1
stare.	1
And	1
men	1
kept	1
passing	1
back	1
from	1
business	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
their	1
clubs	1
—	1
men	1
whose	1
figures	1
shrouded	1
in	1
cocoons	1
of	1
fog	1
came	1
into	1
view	1
like	1
spectres,	1
and	1
like	1
spectres	1
vanished.	1
Then	1
even	1
in	1
his	1
compassion	1
George’s	1
Quilpish	1
humour	1
broke	1
forth	1
in	1
a	1
sudden	1
longing	1
to	1
pluck	1
these	1
spectres	1
by	1
the	1
sleeve,	1
and	1
say:	1
“Hi,	1
you	1
Johnnies!	1
You	1
don’t	1
often	1
see	1
a	1
show	1
like	1
this!	1
Here’s	1
a	1
poor	1
devil	1
whose	1
mistress	1
has	1
just	1
been	1
telling	1
him	1
a	1
pretty	1
little	1
story	1
of	1
her	1
husband;	1
walk	1
up,	1
walk	1
up!	1
He’s	1
taken	1
the	1
knock,	1
you	1
see.”	1
In	1
fancy	1
he	1
saw	1
them	1
gaping	1
round	1
the	1
tortured	1
lover;	1
and	1
grinned	1
as	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
some	1
respectable,	1
newly-married	1
spectre	1
enabled	1
by	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
affections	1
to	1
catch	1
an	1
inkling	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
within	1
Bosinney;	1
he	1
fancied	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
his	1
mouth	1
getting	1
wider	1
and	1
wider,	1
and	1
the	1
fog	1
going	1
down	1
and	1
down.	1
For	1
in	1
George	1
was	1
all	1
that	1
contempt	1
of	1
the	1
of	1
the	1
married	1
middle-class	1
—	1
peculiar	1
to	1
the	1
wild	1
and	1
sportsmanlike	1
spirits	1
in	1
its	1
ranks.	1
But	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
bored.	1
Waiting	1
was	1
not	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
bargained	1
for.	1
‘After	1
all,’	1
he	1
thought,	1
‘the	1
poor	1
chap	1
will	1
get	1
over	1
it;	1
not	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
has	1
happened	1
in	1
this	1
little	1
city!’	1
But	1
now	1
his	1
quarry	1
again	1
began	1
muttering	1
words	1
of	1
violent	1
hate	1
and	1
anger.	1
And	1
following	1
a	1
sudden	1
impulse	1
George	1
touched	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder.	1
Bosinney	1
spun	1
round.	1
“Who	1
are	1
you?	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
want?”	1
George	1
could	1
have	1
stood	1
it	1
well	1
enough	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
gas	1
lamps,	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
that	1
everyday	1
world	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
hardy	1
a	1
connoisseur;	1
but	1
in	1
this	1
fog,	1
where	1
all	1
was	1
gloomy	1
and	1
unreal,	1
where	1
nothing	1
had	1
that	1
matter-of-fact	1
value	1
associated	1
by	1
Forsytes	1
with	1
earth,	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
victim	1
to	1
strange	1
qualms,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
stare	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
this	1
maniac,	1
he	1
thought:	1
‘If	1
I	1
see	1
a	1
bobby,	1
I’ll	1
hand	1
him	1
over;	1
he’s	1
not	1
fit	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
large.’	1
But	1
waiting	1
for	1
no	1
answer,	1
Bosinney	1
strode	1
off	1
into	1
the	1
fog,	1
and	1
George	1
followed,	1
keeping	1
perhaps	1
a	1
little	1
further	1
off,	1
yet	1
more	1
than	1
ever	1
set	1
on	1
tracking	1
him	1
down.	1
‘He	1
can’t	1
go	1
on	1
long	1
like	1
this,’	1
he	1
thought.	1
‘It’s	1
God’s	1
own	1
miracle	1
he’s	1
not	1
been	1
run	1
over	1
already.’	1
He	1
brooded	1
no	1
more	1
on	1
policemen,	1
a	1
sportsman’s	1
sacred	1
fire	1
alive	1
again	1
within	1
him.	1
Into	1
a	1
denser	1
gloom	1
than	1
ever	1
Bosinney	1
held	1
on	1
at	1
a	1
furious	1
pace;	1
but	1
his	1
pursuer	1
perceived	1
more	1
method	1
in	1
his	1
madness	1
—	1
he	1
was	1
clearly	1
making	1
his	1
way	1
westwards.	1
‘He’s	1
really	1
going	1
for	1
Soames!’	1
thought	1
George.	1
The	1
idea	1
was	1
attractive.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
sporting	1
end	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
chase.	1
He	1
had	1
always	1
disliked	1
his	1
cousin.	1
The	1
shaft	1
of	1
a	1
passing	1
cab	1
brushed	1
against	1
his	1
shoulder	1
and	1
made	1
him	1
leap	1
aside.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
intend	1
to	1
be	1
killed	1
for	1
the	1
Buccaneer,	1
or	1
anyone.	1
Yet,	1
with	1
hereditary	1
tenacity,	1
he	1
stuck	1
to	1
the	1
trail	1
through	1
vapour	1
that	1
blotted	1
out	1
everything	1
but	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
the	1
hunted	1
man	1
and	1
the	1
dim	1
moon	1
of	1
the	1
nearest	1
lamp.	1
Then	1
suddenly,	1
with	1
the	1
instinct	1
of	1
a	1
town-stroller,	1
George	1
knew	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
Piccadilly.	1
Here	1
he	1
could	1
find	1
his	1
way	1
blindfold;	1
and	1
freed	1
from	1
the	1
strain	1
of	1
geographical	1
uncertainty,	1
his	1
mind	1
returned	1
to	1
Bosinney’s	1
trouble.	1
Down	1
the	1
long	1
avenue	1
of	1
his	1
man-about-town	1
experience,	1
bursting,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
through	1
a	1
smirch	1
of	1
doubtful	1
amours,	1
there	1
stalked	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
memory	1
of	1
his	1
youth.	1
A	1
memory,	1
poignant	1
still,	1
that	1
brought	1
the	1
scent	1
of	1
hay,	1
the	1
gleam	1
of	1
moonlight,	1
a	1
summer	1
magic,	1
into	1
the	1
reek	1
and	1
blackness	1
of	1
this	1
London	1
fog	1
—	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
a	1
night	1
when	1
in	1
the	1
darkest	1
shadow	1
of	1
a	1
lawn	1
he	1
had	1
overheard	1
from	1
a	1
woman’s	1
lips	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
her	1
sole	1
possessor.	1
And	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
George	1
walked	1
no	1
longer	1
in	1
black	1
Piccadilly,	1
but	1
lay	1
again,	1
with	1
hell	1
in	1
his	1
heart,	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
sweet-smelling,	1
dewy	1
grass,	1
in	1
the	1
long	1
shadow	1
of	1
poplars	1
that	1
hid	1
the	1
moon.	1
A	1
longing	1
seized	1
him	1
to	1
throw	1
his	1
arm	1
round	1
the	1
Buccaneer,	1
and	1
say,	1
“Come,	1
old	1
boy.	1
Time	1
cures	1
all.	1
Let’s	1
go	1
and	1
drink	1
it	1
off!”	1
But	1
a	1
voice	1
yelled	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
started	1
back.	1
A	1
cab	1
rolled	1
out	1
of	1
blackness,	1
and	1
into	1
blackness	1
disappeared.	1
And	1
suddenly	1
George	1
perceived	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
lost	1
Bosinney.	1
He	1
ran	1
forward	1
and	1
back,	1
felt	1
his	1
heart	1
clutched	1
by	1
a	1
sickening	1
fear,	1
the	1
dark	1
fear	1
which	1
lives	1
in	1
the	1
wings	1
of	1
the	1
fog.	1
Perspiration	1
started	1
out	1
on	1
his	1
brow.	1
He	1
stood	1
quite	1
still,	1
listening	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
might.	1
“And	1
then,”	1
as	1
he	1
confided	1
to	1
Dartie	1
the	1
same	1
evening	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
a	1
game	1
of	1
billiards	1
at	1
the	1
Red	1
Pottle,	1
“I	1
lost	1
him.”	1
Dartie	1
twirled	1
complacently	1
at	1
his	1
dark	1
moustache.	1
He	1
had	1
just	1
put	1
together	1
a	1
neat	1
break	1
of	1
twenty-three	1
—	1
failing	1
at	1
a	1
‘Jenny.’	1
“And	1
who	1
was	1
she?”	1
he	1
asked.	1
George	1
looked	1
slowly	1
at	1
the	1
‘man	1
of	1
the	1
world’s’	1
fattish,	1
sallow	1
face,	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
grim	1
smile	1
lurked	1
about	1
the	1
curves	1
of	1
his	1
cheeks	1
and	1
his	1
heavy-lidded	1
eyes.	1
‘No,	1
no,	1
my	1
fine	1
fellow,’	1
he	1
thought,	1
‘I’m	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
tell	1
you.’	1
For	1
though	1
he	1
mixed	1
with	1
Dartie	1
a	1
good	1
deal,	1
he	1
thought	1
him	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
a	1
cad.	1
“Oh,	1
some	1
little	1
love-lady	1
or	1
other,”	1
he	1
said,	1
and	1
chalked	1
his	1
cue.	1
“A	1
love-lady!”	1
exclaimed	1
Dartie	1
—	1
he	1
used	1
a	1
more	1
figurative	1
expression.	1
“I	1
made	1
sure	1
it	1
was	1
our	1
friend	1
Soa.	1
.	3
”	1
“Did	1
you?”	1
said	1
George	1
curtly.	1
“Then	1
damme	1
you’ve	1
made	1
an	1
error.”	1
He	1
missed	1
his	1
shot.	1
He	1
was	1
careful	1
not	1
to	1
allude	1
to	1
the	1
subject	1
again	1
till,	1
towards	1
eleven	1
o’clock,	1
having,	1
in	1
his	1
poetic	1
phraseology,	1
‘looked	1
upon	1
the	1
drink	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
yellow,’	1
he	1
drew	1
aside	1
the	1
blind,	1
and	1
gazed	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
street.	1
The	1
murky	1
blackness	1
of	1
the	1
fog	1
was	1
but	1
faintly	1
broken	1
by	1
the	1
lamps	1
of	1
the	1
‘Red	1
Pottle,’	1
and	1
no	1
shape	1
of	1
mortal	1
man	1
or	1
thing	1
was	1
in	1
sight.	1
“I	1
can’t	1
help	1
thinking	1
of	1
that	1
poor	1
Buccaneer,”	1
he	1
said.	1
“He	1
may	1
be	1
wandering	1
out	1
there	1
now	1
in	1
that	1
fog.	1
If	1
he’s	1
not	1
a	1
corpse,”	1
he	1
added	1
with	1
strange	1
dejection.	1
“Corpse!”	1
said	1
Dartie,	1
in	1
whom	1
the	1
recollection	1
of	1
his	1
defeat	1
at	1
Richmond	1
flared	1
up.	1
“He’s	1
all	1
right.	1
Ten	1
to	1
one	1
if	1
he	1
wasn’t	1
tight!”	1
George	1
turned	1
on	1
him,	1
looking	1
really	1
formidable,	1
with	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
savage	1
gloom	1
on	1
his	1
big	1
face.	1
“Dry	1
up!”	1
he	1
said.	1
“Don’t	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
he’s	1
‘taken	1
the	1
knock!”’	1
Chapter	1
28	1
The	1
Trial	1
In	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
his	1
case,	1
which	1
was	1
second	1
in	1
the	1
list,	1
Soames	1
was	1
again	1
obliged	1
to	1
start	1
without	1
seeing	1
Irene,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
just	1
as	1
well,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
as	1
yet	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
what	1
attitude	1
to	1
adopt	1
towards	1
her.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
requested	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
court	1
by	1
half-past	1
ten,	1
to	1
provide	1
against	1
the	1
event	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
action	1
(a	1
breach	1
of	1
promise)	1
collapsing,	1
which	1
however	1
it	1
did	1
not,	1
both	1
sides	1
showing	1
a	1
courage	1
that	1
afforded	1
Waterbuck,	1
Q.C.,	1
an	1
opportunity	1
for	1
improving	1
his	1
already	1
great	1
reputation	1
in	1
this	1
class	1
of	1
case.	1
He	1
was	1
opposed	1
by	1
Ram,	1
the	1
other	1
celebrated	1
breach	1
of	1
promise	1
man.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
battle	1
of	1
giants.	1
The	1
court	1
delivered	1
judgment	1
just	1
before	1
the	1
luncheon	1
interval.	1
The	1
jury	1
left	1
the	1
box	1
for	1
good,	1
and	1
Soames	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
get	1
something	1
to	1
eat.	1
He	1
met	1
James	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
little	1
luncheon-bar,	1
like	1
a	1
pelican	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness	1
of	1
the	1
galleries,	1
bent	1
over	1
a	1
sandwich	1
with	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
sherry	1
before	1
him.	1
The	1
spacious	1
emptiness	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
central	1
hall,	1
over	1
which	1
father	1
and	1
son	1
brooded	1
as	1
they	1
stood	1
together,	1
was	1
marred	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
for	1
a	1
fleeting	1
moment	1
by	1
barristers	1
in	1
wig	1
and	1
gown	1
hurriedly	1
bolting	1
across,	1
by	1
an	1
occasional	1
old	1
lady	1
or	1
rusty-coated	1
man,	1
looking	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
frightened	1
way,	1
and	1
by	1
two	1
persons,	1
bolder	1
than	1
their	1
generation,	1
seated	1
in	1
an	1
embrasure	1
arguing.	1
The	1
sound	1
of	1
their	1
voices	1
arose,	1
together	1
with	1
a	1
scent	1
as	1
of	1
neglected	1
wells,	1
which,	1
mingling	1
with	1
the	1
odour	1
of	1
the	1
galleries,	1
combined	1
to	1
form	1
the	1
savour,	1
like	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
emanation	1
of	1
a	1
refined	1
cheese,	1
so	1
indissolubly	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
administration	1
of	1
British	1
Justice.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
long	1
before	1
James	1
addressed	1
his	1
son.	1
“When’s	1
your	1
case	1
coming	1
on?	1
I	1
suppose	1
it’ll	1
be	1
on	1
directly.	1
I	1
shouldn’t	1
wonder	1
if	1
this	1
Bosinney’d	1
say	1
anything;	1
I	1
should	1
think	1
he’d	1
have	1
to.	1
He’ll	1
go	1
bankrupt	1
if	1
it	1
goes	1
against	1
him.”	1
He	1
took	1
a	1
large	1
bite	1
at	1
his	1
sandwich	1
and	1
a	1
mouthful	1
of	1
sherry.	1
“Your	1
mother,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“wants	1
you	1
and	1
Irene	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
dine	1
to-night.”	1
A	1
chill	1
smile	1
played	1
round	1
Soames’	1
lips;	1
he	1
looked	1
back	1
at	1
his	1
father.	1
Anyone	1
who	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
look,	1
cold	1
and	1
furtive,	1
thus	1
interchanged,	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
pardoned	1
for	1
not	1
appreciating	1
the	1
real	1
understanding	1
between	1
them.	1
James	1
finished	1
his	1
sherry	1
at	1
a	1
draught.	1
“How	1
much?”	1
he	1
asked.	1
On	1
returning	1
to	1
the	1
court	1
Soames	1
took	1
at	1
once	1
his	1
rightful	1
seat	1
on	1
the	1
front	1
bench	1
beside	1
his	1
solicitor.	1
He	1
ascertained	1
where	1
his	1
father	1
was	1
seated	1
with	1
a	1
glance	1
so	1
sidelong	1
as	1
to	1
commit	1
nobody.	1
James,	1
sitting	1
back	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
clasped	1
over	1
the	1
handle	1
of	1
his	1
umbrella,	1
was	1
brooding	1
on	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
bench	1
immediately	1
behind	1
counsel,	1
whence	1
he	1
could	1
get	1
away	1
at	1
once	1
when	1
the	1
case	1
was	1
over.	1
He	1
considered	1
Bosinney’s	1
conduct	1
in	1
every	1
way	1
outrageous,	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
run	1
up	1
against	1
him,	1
feeling	1
that	1
the	1
meeting	1
would	1
be	1
awkward.	1
Next	1
to	1
the	1
Divorce	1
Court,	1
this	1
court	1
was,	1
perhaps,	1
the	1
favourite	1
emporium	1
of	1
justice,	1
libel,	1
breach	1
of	1
promise,	1
and	1
other	1
commercial	1
actions	1
being	1
frequently	1
decided	1
there.	1
Quite	1
a	1
sprinkling	1
of	1
persons	1
unconnected	1
with	1
the	1
law	1
occupied	1
the	1
back	1
benches,	1
and	1
the	1
hat	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
or	1
two	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
gallery.	1
The	1
two	1
rows	1
of	1
seats	1
immediately	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
James	1
were	1
gradually	1
filled	1
by	1
barristers	1
in	1
wigs,	1
who	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
make	1
pencil	1
notes,	1
chat,	1
and	1
attend	1
to	1
their	1
teeth;	1
but	1
his	1
interest	1
was	1
soon	1
diverted	1
from	1
these	1
lesser	1
lights	1
of	1
justice	1
by	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
Waterbuck,	1
Q.C.,	1
with	1
the	1
wings	1
of	1
his	1
silk	1
gown	1
rustling,	1
and	1
his	1
red,	1
capable	1
face	1
supported	1
by	1
two	1
short,	1
brown	1
whiskers.	1
The	1
famous	1
Q.C.	1
looked,	1
as	1
James	1
freely	1
admitted,	1
the	1
very	1
picture	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
could	1
heckle	1
a	1
witness.	1
For	1
all	1
his	1
experience,	1
it	1
so	1
happened	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
Waterbuck,	1
Q.C.,	1
before,	1
and,	1
like	1
many	1
Forsytes	1
in	1
the	1
lower	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
profession,	1
he	1
had	1
an	1
extreme	1
admiration	1
for	1
a	1
good	1
cross-examiner.	1
The	1
long,	1
lugubrious	1
folds	1
in	1
his	1
cheeks	1
relaxed	1
somewhat	1
after	1
seeing	1
him,	1
especially	1
as	1
he	1
now	1
perceived	1
that	1
Soames	1
alone	1
was	1
represented	1
by	1
silk.	1
Waterbuck,	1
Q.C.,	1
had	1
barely	1
screwed	1
round	1
on	1
his	1
elbow	1
to	1
chat	1
with	1
his	1
Junior	1
before	1
Mr.	1
Justice	1
Bentham	1
himself	1
appeared	1
—	1
a	1
thin,	1
rather	1
hen-like	1
man,	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
stoop,	1
clean-shaven	1
under	1
his	1
snowy	1
wig.	1
Like	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
court,	1
Waterbuck	1
rose,	1
and	1
remained	1
on	1
his	1
feet	1
until	1
the	1
judge	1
was	1
seated.	1
James	1
rose	1
but	1
slightly;	1
he	1
was	1
already	1
comfortable,	1
and	1
had	1
no	1
opinion	1
of	1
Bentham,	1
having	1
sat	1
next	1
but	1
one	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
dinner	1
twice	1
at	1
the	1
Bumley	1
Tomms’.	1
Bumley	1
Tomm	1
was	1
rather	1
a	1
poor	1
thing,	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
successful.	1
James	1
himself	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
his	1
first	1
brief.	1
He	1
was	1
excited,	1
too,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
found	1
out	1
that	1
Bosinney	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
court.	1
‘Now,	1
what’s	1
he	1
mean	1
by	1
that?’	1
he	1
kept	1
on	1
thinking.	1
The	1
case	1
having	1
been	1
called	1
on,	1
Waterbuck,	1
Q.C.,	1
pushing	1
back	1
his	1
papers,	1
hitched	1
his	1
gown	1
on	1
his	1
shoulder,	1
and,	1
with	1
a	1
semi-circular	1
look	1
around	1
him,	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
bat,	1
arose	1
and	1
addressed	1
the	1
Court.	1
The	1
facts,	1
he	1
said,	1
were	1
not	1
in	1
dispute,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
his	1
Lordship	1
would	1
be	1
asked	1
was	1
to	1
interpret	1
the	1
correspondence	1
which	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
between	1
his	1
client	1
and	1
the	1
defendant,	1
an	1
architect,	1
with	1
reference	1
to	1
the	1
decoration	1
of	1
a	1
house.	1
He	1
would,	1
however,	1
submit	1
that	1
this	1
correspondence	1
could	1
only	1
mean	1
one	1
very	1
plain	1
thing.	1
After	1
briefly	1
reciting	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
at	1
Robin	1
Hill,	1
which	1
he	1
described	1
as	1
a	1
mansion,	1
and	1
the	1
actual	1
facts	1
of	1
expenditure,	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
as	1
follows:	1
“My	1
client,	1
Mr.	1
Soames	1
Forsyte,	1
is	1
a	1
gentleman,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
property,	1
who	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
last	1
to	1
dispute	1
any	1
legitimate	1
claim	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
made	1
against	1
him,	1
but	1
he	1
has	1
met	1
with	1
such	1
treatment	1
from	1
his	1
architect	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1
of	1
this	1
house,	1
over	1
which	1
he	1
has,	1
as	1
your	1
lordship	1
has	1
heard,	1
already	1
spent	1
some	1
twelve	1
—	1
some	1
twelve	1
thousand	1
pounds,	1
a	1
sum	1
considerably	1
in	1
advance	1
of	1
the	1
amount	1
he	1
had	1
originally	1
contemplated,	1
that	1
as	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
principle	1
—	1
and	1
this	1
I	1
cannot	1
too	1
strongly	1
emphasize	1
—	1
as	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
principle,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
interests	1
of	1
others,	1
he	1
has	1
felt	1
himself	1
compelled	1
to	1
bring	1
this	1
action.	1
The	1
point	1
put	1
forward	1
in	1
defence	1
by	1
the	1
architect	1
I	1
will	1
suggest	1
to	1
your	1
lordship	1
is	1
not	1
worthy	1
of	1
a	1
moment’s	1
serious	1
consideration.”	1
He	1
then	1
read	1
the	1
correspondence.	1
His	1
client,	1
“a	1
man	1
of	1
recognised	1
position,”	1
was	1
prepared	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
box,	1
and	1
to	1
swear	1
that	1
he	1
never	1
did	1
authorize,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
never	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
authorize,	1
the	1
expenditure	1
of	1
any	1
money	1
beyond	1
the	1
extreme	1
limit	1
of	1
twelve	1
thousand	1
and	1
fifty	1
pounds,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
clearly	1
fixed;	1
and	1
not	1
further	1
to	1
waste	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
court,	1
he	1
would	1
at	1
once	1
call	1
Mr.	1
Forsyte.	1
Soames	1
then	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
box.	1
His	1
whole	1
appearance	1
was	1
striking	1
in	1
its	1
composure.	1
His	1
face,	1
just	1
supercilious	1
enough,	1
pale	1
and	1
clean-shaven,	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
line	1
between	1
the	1
eyes,	1
and	1
compressed	1
lips;	1
his	1
dress	1
in	1
unostentatious	1
order,	1
one	1
hand	1
neatly	1
gloved,	1
the	1
other	1
bare.	1
He	1
answered	1
the	1
questions	1
put	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
somewhat	1
low,	1
but	1
distinct	1
voice.	1
His	1
evidence	1
under	1
cross-examination	1
savoured	1
of	1
taciturnity.	1
Had	1
he	1
not	1
used	1
the	1
expression,	1
“a	1
free	1
hand”?	1
No.	1
“Come,	1
come!”	1
The	1
expression	1
he	1
had	1
used	1
was	1
‘a	1
free	1
hand	1
in	1
the	1
terms	1
of	1
this	1
correspondence.’	1
“Would	1
you	1
tell	1
the	1
Court	1
that	2
was	1
English?”	1
“Yes!”	1
“What	1
do	1
you	1
say	1
it	1
means?”	1
“What	1
it	1
says!”	1
“Are	1
you	1
prepared	1
to	1
deny	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
contradiction	1
in	1
terms?”	1
“Yes.”	1
“You	1
are	1
not	1
an	1
Irishman?”	1
“No.”	1
“Are	1
you	1
a	1
well-educated	1
man?”	1
“Yes.”	1
“And	1
yet	1
you	1
persist	1
in	1
that	1
statement?”	1
“Yes.”	1
Throughout	1
this	1
and	1
much	1
more	1
cross-examination,	1
which	1
turned	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
around	1
the	1
‘nice	1
point,’	1
James	1
sat	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
behind	1
his	1
ear,	1
his	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
upon	1
his	1
son.	1
He	1
was	1
proud	1
of	1
him!	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
feel	1
that	1
in	1
similar	1
circumstances	1
he	1
himself	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
tempted	1
to	1
enlarge	1
his	1
replies,	1
but	1
his	1
instinct	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
this	1
taciturnity	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
thing.	1
He	1
sighed	1
with	1
relief,	1
however,	1
when	1
Soames,	1
slowly	1
turning,	1
and	1
without	1
any	1
change	1
of	1
expression,	1
descended	1
from	1
the	1
box.	1
When	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
turn	1
of	1
Bosinney’s	1
Counsel	1
to	1
address	1
the	1
Judge,	1
James	1
redoubled	1
his	1
attention,	1
and	1
he	1
searched	1
the	1
Court	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
Bosinney	1
were	1
not	1
somewhere	1
concealed.	1
Young	1
Chankery	1
began	1
nervously;	1
he	1
was	1
placed	1
by	1
Bosinney’s	1
absence	1
in	1
an	1
awkward	1
position.	1
He	1
therefore	1
did	1
his	1
best	1
to	1
turn	1
that	1
absence	1
to	1
account.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
fear	1
—	1
he	1
said	1
—	1
that	1
his	1
client	1
had	1
met	1
with	1
an	1
accident.	1
He	1
had	1
fully	1
expected	1
him	1
there	1
to	1
give	1
evidence;	1
they	1
had	1
sent	1
round	1
that	1
morning	1
both	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Bosinney’s	1
office	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
rooms	1
(though	1
he	1
knew	1
they	1
were	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same,	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
well	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
so),	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
known	1
where	1
he	1
was,	1
and	1
this	1
he	1
considered	1
to	1
be	1
ominous,	1
knowing	1
how	1
anxious	1
Mr.	1
Bosinney	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
give	1
his	1
evidence.	1
He	1
had	1
not,	1
however,	1
been	1
instructed	1
to	1
apply	1
for	1
an	1
adjournment,	1
and	1
in	1
default	1
of	1
such	1
instruction	1
he	1
conceived	1
it	1
his	1
duty	1
to	1
go	1
on.	1
The	1
plea	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
somewhat	1
confidently	1
relied,	1
and	1
which	1
his	1
client,	1
had	1
he	1
not	1
unfortunately	1
been	1
prevented	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
from	1
attending,	1
would	1
have	1
supported	1
by	1
his	1
evidence,	1
was	1
that	1
such	1
an	1
expression	1
as	1
a	1
‘free	1
hand’	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
limited,	1
fettered,	1
and	1
rendered	1
unmeaning,	1
by	1
any	1
verbiage	1
which	1
might	1
follow	1
it.	1
He	1
would	1
go	1
further	1
and	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
correspondence	1
showed	1
that	1
whatever	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
said	1
in	1
his	1
evidence,	1
Mr.	1
Forsyte	1
had	1
in	1
fact	1
never	1
contemplated	1
repudiating	1
liability	1
on	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
work	1
ordered	1
or	1
executed	1
by	1
his	1
architect.	1
The	1
defendant	1
had	1
certainly	1
never	1
contemplated	1
such	1
a	1
contingency,	1
or,	1
as	1
was	1
demonstrated	1
by	1
his	1
letters,	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
proceeded	1
with	1
the	1
work	1
—	1
a	1
work	1
of	1
extreme	1
delicacy,	1
carried	1
out	1
with	1
great	1
care	1
and	1
efficiency,	1
to	1
meet	1
and	1
satisfy	1
the	1
fastidious	1
taste	1
of	1
a	1
connoisseur,	1
a	1
rich	1
man,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
property.	1
He	1
felt	1
strongly	1
on	1
this	1
point,	1
and	1
feeling	1
strongly	1
he	1
used,	1
perhaps,	1
rather	1
strong	1
words	1
when	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
this	1
action	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
most	1
unjustifiable,	1
unexpected,	1
indeed	1
—	1
unprecedented	1
character.	1
If	1
his	1
Lordship	1
had	2
the	1
opportunity	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
had	1
made	1
it	1
his	1
duty	1
to	1
take,	1
to	1
go	1
over	1
this	1
very	1
fine	1
house	1
and	1
see	1
the	1
great	1
delicacy	1
and	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
decorations	1
executed	1
by	1
his	1
client	1
—	1
an	1
artist	1
in	1
his	1
most	1
honourable	1
profession	1
—	1
he	1
felt	1
convinced	1
that	1
not	1
for	1
one	1
moment	1
would	1
his	1
Lordship	1
tolerate	1
this,	1
he	1
would	1
use	1
no	1
stronger	1
word	1
than	1
daring	1
attempt	1
to	1
evade	1
legitimate	1
responsibility.	1
Taking	1
the	1
text	1
of	1
Soames’	1
letters,	1
he	1
lightly	1
touched	1
on	1
‘Boileau	1
v.	1
The	1
Blasted	1
Cement	1
Company,	1
Limited.’	1
“It	1
is	1
doubtful,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“what	1
that	1
authority	1
has	1
decided;	1
in	1
any	1
case	1
I	1
would	1
submit	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
just	1
as	1
much	1
in	1
my	1
favour	1
as	1
in	1
my	1
friend’s.”	1
He	1
then	1
argued	1
the	1
‘nice	1
point’	1
closely.	1
With	1
all	1
due	1
deference	1
he	1
submitted	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Forsyte’s	1
expression	1
nullified	1
itself.	1
His	1
client	1
not	1
being	1
a	1
rich	1
man,	1
the	1
matter	1
was	1
a	1
serious	1
one	1
for	1
him;	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
talented	1
architect,	1
whose	1
professional	1
reputation	1
was	1
undoubtedly	1
somewhat	1
at	1
stake.	1
He	1
concluded	1
with	1
a	1
perhaps	1
too	1
personal	1
appeal	1
to	1
the	1
Judge,	1
as	1
a	1
lover	1
of	1
the	1
arts,	1
to	1
show	1
himself	1
the	1
protector	1
of	1
artists,	1
from	1
what	1
was	1
occasionally	1
—	1
he	1
said	1
occasionally	1
—	1
the	1
too	1
iron	1
hand	1
of	1
capital.	1
“What,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“will	1
be	1
the	1
position	1
of	1
the	1
artistic	1
professions,	1
if	1
men	1
of	1
property	1
like	1
this	1
Mr.	1
Forsyte	1
refuse,	1
and	1
are	1
allowed	1
to	1
refuse,	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
the	1
obligations	1
of	1
the	1
commissions	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
given.”	1
He	1
would	1
now	1
call	1
his	1
client,	1
in	1
case	1
he	1
should	1
at	1
the	1
last	1
moment	1
have	1
found	1
himself	1
able	1
to	1
be	1
present.	1
The	1
name	1
Philip	1
Baynes	1
Bosinney	1
was	1
called	1
three	1
times	1
by	1
the	1
Ushers,	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
calling	1
echoed	1
with	1
strange	1
melancholy	1
throughout	1
the	1
Court	1
and	1
Galleries.	1
The	1
crying	1
of	1
this	1
name,	1
to	1
which	1
no	1
answer	1
was	1
returned,	1
had	1
upon	1
James	1
a	1
curious	1
effect:	1
it	1
was	1
like	1
calling	1
for	1
your	1
lost	1
dog	1
about	1
the	1
streets.	1
And	1
the	1
creepy	1
feeling	1
that	1
it	1
gave	1
him,	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
missing,	1
grated	1
on	1
his	1
sense	1
of	1
comfort	1
and	1
security-on	1
his	1
cosiness.	1
Though	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
said	1
why,	1
it	1
made	1
him	1
feel	1
uneasy.	1
He	1
looked	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
clock	1
—	1
a	1
quarter	1
to	1
three!	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
all	1
over	1
in	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour.	1
Where	1
could	1
the	1
young	1
fellow	1
be?	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
when	1
Mr.	1
Justice	1
Bentham	1
delivered	1
judgment	1
that	1
he	1
got	1
over	1
the	1
turn	1
he	1
had	1
received.	1
Behind	1
the	1
wooden	1
erection,	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
fenced	1
from	1
more	1
ordinary	1
mortals,	1
the	1
learned	1
Judge	1
leaned	1
forward.	1
The	1
electric	1
light,	1
just	1
turned	1
on	1
above	1
his	1
head,	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
mellowed	1
it	1
to	1
an	1
orange	1
hue	1
beneath	1
the	1
snowy	1
crown	1
of	1
his	1
wig;	1
the	1
amplitude	1
of	1
his	1
robes	1
grew	1
before	1
the	1
eye;	1
his	1
whole	1
figure,	1
facing	1
the	1
comparative	1
dusk	1
of	1
the	1
Court,	1
radiated	1
like	1
some	1
majestic	1
and	1
sacred	1
body.	1
He	1
cleared	1
his	1
throat,	1
took	1
a	1
sip	1
of	1
water,	1
broke	1
the	1
nib	1
of	1
a	1
quill	1
against	1
the	1
desk,	1
and,	1
folding	1
his	1
bony	1
hands	1
before	1
him,	1
began.	1
To	1
James	1
he	1
suddenly	1
loomed	1
much	1
larger	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
thought	1
Bentham	1
would	1
loom.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
majesty	1
of	1
the	1
law;	1
and	1
a	1
person	1
endowed	1
with	1
a	1
nature	1
far	1
less	1
matter-of-fact	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
James	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
excused	1
for	1
failing	1
to	1
pierce	1
this	1
halo,	1
and	1
disinter	1
therefrom	1
the	1
somewhat	1
ordinary	1
Forsyte,	1
who	1
walked	1
and	1
talked	1
in	1
every-day	1
life	1
under	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
Bentham.	1
He	1
delivered	1
judgment	1
in	1
the	1
following	1
words:	1
“The	1
facts	1
in	1
this	1
case	1
are	1
not	1
in	1
dispute.	1
On	1
May	1
15	1
last	1
the	1
defendant	1
wrote	1
to	1
the	1
plaintiff,	1
requesting	1
to	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
withdraw	1
from	1
his	1
professional	1
position	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
decoration	1
of	1
the	1
plaintiff’s	1
house,	1
unless	1
he	1
were	1
given	1
‘a	1
free	1
hand.’	1
The	1
plaintiff,	1
on	1
May	1
17,	1
wrote	1
back	1
as	1
follows:	1
‘In	1
giving	1
you,	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
your	1
request,	1
this	1
free	1
hand,	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
to	1
clearly	1
understand	1
that	1
the	1
total	1
cost	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
as	1
handed	1
over	1
to	1
me	1
completely	1
decorated,	1
inclusive	1
of	1
your	1
fee	1
(as	1
arranged	1
between	1
us)	1
must	1
not	1
exceed	1
twelve	1
thousand	1
pounds.’	1
To	1
this	1
letter	1
the	1
defendant	1
replied	1
on	1
May	1
18:	1
‘If	1
you	1
think	1
that	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
delicate	1
matter	1
as	1
decoration	1
I	1
can	1
bind	1
myself	1
to	1
the	1
exact	1
pound,	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
you	1
are	1
mistaken.’	1
On	1
May	1
19	1
the	1
plaintiff	1
wrote	1
as	1
follows:	1
‘I	1
did	1
not	1
mean	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
should	1
exceed	1
the	1
sum	1
named	1
in	1
my	1
letter	1
to	1
you	1
by	1
ten	1
or	1
twenty	1
or	1
even	1
fifty	1
pounds	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
any	1
difficulty	1
between	1
us.	1
You	1
have	1
a	1
free	1
hand	1
in	1
the	1
terms	1
of	1
this	1
correspondence,	1
and	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
your	1
way	1
to	1
completing	1
the	1
decorations.’	1
On	1
May	1
20	1
the	1
defendant	1
replied	1
thus	1
shortly:	1
‘Very	1
well.’	1
“In	1
completing	1
these	1
decorations,	1
the	1
defendant	1
incurred	1
liabilities	1
and	1
expenses	1
which	1
brought	1
the	1
total	1
cost	1
of	1
this	1
house	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
twelve	1
thousand	1
four	1
hundred	1
pounds,	1
all	1
of	1
which	1
expenditure	1
has	1
been	1
defrayed	1
by	1
the	1
plaintiff.	1
This	1
action	1
has	1
been	1
brought	1
by	1
the	1
plaintiff	1
to	1
recover	1
from	1
the	1
defendant	1
the	1
sum	1
of	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
pounds	1
expended	1
by	1
him	1
in	1
excess	1
of	1
a	1
sum	1
of	1
twelve	1
thousand	1
and	1
fifty	1
pounds,	1
alleged	1
by	1
the	1
plaintiff	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
fixed	1
by	1
this	1
correspondence	1
as	1
the	1
maximum	1
sum	1
that	1
the	1
defendant	1
had	1
authority	1
to	1
expend.	1
“The	1
question	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
decide	1
is	1
whether	1
or	1
no	1
the	1
defendant	1
is	1
liable	1
to	1
refund	1
to	1
the	1
plaintiff	1
this	1
sum.	1
In	1
my	1
judgment	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
liable.	1
“What	1
in	1
effect	1
the	1
plaintiff	1
has	1
said	1
is	1
this	1
‘I	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
free	1
hand	1
to	1
complete	1
these	1
decorations,	1
provided	1
that	1
you	1
keep	1
within	1
a	1
total	1
cost	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
twelve	1
thousand	1
pounds.	1
If	1
you	1
exceed	1
that	1
sum	1
by	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
fifty	1
pounds,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
hold	1
you	1
responsible;	1
beyond	1
that	1
point	1
you	1
are	1
no	1
agent	1
of	1
mine,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
repudiate	1
liability.’	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
quite	1
clear	1
to	1
me	1
whether,	1
had	1
the	1
plaintiff	1
in	1
fact	1
repudiated	1
liability	1
under	1
his	1
agent’s	1
contracts,	1
he	1
would,	1
under	1
all	1
the	1
circumstances,	1
have	1
been	1
successful	1
in	1
so	1
doing;	1
but	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
adopted	1
this	1
course.	1
He	1
has	1
accepted	1
liability,	1
and	1
fallen	1
back	1
upon	1
his	1
rights	1
against	1
the	1
defendant	1
under	1
the	1
terms	1
of	1
the	1
latter’s	1
engagement.	1
“In	1
my	1
judgment	1
the	1
plaintiff	1
is	1
entitled	1
to	1
recover	1
this	1
sum	1
from	1
the	1
defendant.	1
“It	1
has	1
been	1
sought,	1
on	1
behalf	1
of	1
the	1
defendant,	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
no	1
limit	1
of	1
expenditure	1
was	1
fixed	1
or	1
intended	1
to	1
be	1
fixed	1
by	1
this	1
correspondence.	1
If	1
this	1
were	1
so,	1
I	1
can	1
find	1
no	1
reason	1
for	1
the	1
plaintiff’s	1
importation	1
into	1
the	1
correspondence	1
of	1
the	1
figures	1
of	1
twelve	1
thousand	1
pounds	1
and	1
subsequently	1
of	1
fifty	1
pounds.	1
The	1
defendant’s	1
contention	1
would	1
render	1
these	1
figures	1
meaningless.	1
It	1
is	1
manifest	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
by	1
his	1
letter	1
of	1
May	1
20	1
he	1
assented	1
to	1
a	1
very	1
clear	1
proposition,	1
by	1
the	1
terms	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
held	1
to	1
be	1
bound.	1
“For	1
these	1
reasons	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
judgment	1
for	1
the	1
plaintiff	1
for	1
the	1
amount	1
claimed	1
with	1
costs.”	1
James	1
sighed,	1
and	1
stooping,	1
picked	1
up	1
his	1
umbrella	1
which	1
had	1
fallen	1
with	1
a	1
rattle	1
at	1
the	1
words	1
‘importation	1
into	1
this	1
correspondence.’	1
Untangling	1
his	1
legs,	1
he	1
rapidly	1
left	1
the	1
Court;	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
his	1
son,	1
he	1
snapped	1
up	1
a	1
hansom	1
cab	1
(it	1
was	1
a	1
clear,	1
grey	1
afternoon)	1
and	1
drove	1
straight	1
to	1
Timothy’s	1
where	1
he	1
found	1
Swithin;	1
and	1
to	1
him,	1
Mrs.	1
Septimus	1
Small,	1
and	1
Aunt	1
Hester,	1
he	1
recounted	1
the	1
whole	1
proceedings,	1
eating	1
two	1
muffins	1
not	1
altogether	1
in	1
the	1
intervals	1
of	1
speech.	1
“Soames	1
did	1
very	1
well,”	1
he	1
ended;	1
“he’s	1
got	1
his	1
head	1
screwed	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
way.	1
This	1
won’t	1
please	1
Jolyon.	1
It’s	1
a	1
bad	1
business	1
for	1
that	1
young	1
Bosinney;	1
he’ll	1
go	1
bankrupt,	1
I	1
shouldn’t	1
wonder,”	1
and	1
then	1
after	1
a	1
long	1
pause,	1
during	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
stared	1
disquietly	1
into	1
the	1
fire,	1
he	1
added:	1
“He	1
wasn’t	1
there	1
—	1
now	1
why?”	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
sound	1
of	1
footsteps.	1
The	1
figure	1
of	1
a	1
thick-set	1
man,	1
with	1
the	1
ruddy	1
brown	1
face	1
of	1
robust	1
health,	1
was	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
back	1
drawing-room.	1
The	1
forefinger	1
of	1
his	1
upraised	1
hand	1
was	1
outlined	1
against	1
the	1
black	1
of	1
his	1
frock	1
coat.	1
He	1
spoke	1
in	1
a	1
grudging	1
voice.	1
“Well,	1
James,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“I	1
can’t	1
—	1
I	1
can’t	1
stop,”	1
and	1
turning	1
round,	1
he	1
walked	1
out.	1
It	1
was	1
Timothy.	1
James	1
rose	1
from	1
his	1
chair.	1
“There!”	1
he	1
said,	1
“there!	1
I	1
knew	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
wro.	1
.	3
”	1
He	1
checked	1
himself,	1
and	1
was	1
silent,	1
staring	1
before	1
him,	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
a	1
portent.	1
Chapter	1

Soames	1
Breaks	1
the	1
News	1
In	1
leaving	1
the	1
Court	1
Soames	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
straight	1
home.	1
He	1
felt	1
disinclined	1
for	1
the	1
City,	1
and	1
drawn	1
by	1
need	1
for	1
sympathy	1
in	1
his	1
triumph,	1
he,	1
too,	1
made	1
his	1
way,	1
but	1
slowly	1
and	1
on	1
foot,	1
to	1
Timothy’s	1
in	1
the	1
Bayswater	1
Road.	1
His	1
father	1
had	1
just	1
left;	1
Mrs.	1
Small	1
and	1
Aunt	1
Hester,	1
in	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
story,	1
greeted	1
him	1
warmly.	1
They	1
were	1
sure	1
he	1
was	1
hungry	1
after	1
all	1
that	1
evidence.	1
Smither	1
should	1
toast	1
him	1
some	1
more	1
muffins,	1
his	1
dear	1
father	1
had	1
eaten	1
them	1
all.	1
He	1
must	1
put	1
his	1
legs	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
sofa;	1
and	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
glass	1
of	1
prune	1
brandy	1
too.	1
It	1
was	1
so	1
strengthening.	1
Swithin	1
was	1
still	1
present,	1
having	1
lingered	1
later	1
than	1
his	1
wont,	1
for	1
he	1
felt	1
in	1
want	1
of	1
exercise.	1
On	1
hearing	1
this	1
suggestion,	1
he	1
‘pished.’	1
A	1
pretty	1
pass	1
young	1
men	1
were	1
coming	1
to!	1
His	1
own	1
liver	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
order,	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
anyone	1
else	1
drinking	1
prune	1
brandy.	1
He	1
went	1
away	1
almost	1
immediately,	1
saying	1
to	1
Soames:	1
“And	1
how’s	1
your	1
wife?	1
You	1
tell	1
her	1
from	1
me	1
that	1
if	1
she’s	1
dull,	1
and	1
likes	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
dine	1
with	1
me	1
quietly,	1
I’ll	1
give	1
her	1
such	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
champagne	1
as	1
she	1
doesn’t	1
get	1
every	1
day.”	1
Staring	1
down	1
from	1
his	1
height	1
on	1
Soames	1
he	1
contracted	1
his	1
thick,	1
puffy,	1
yellow	1
hand	1
as	1
though	1
squeezing	1
within	1
it	1
all	1
this	1
small	1
fry,	1
and	1
throwing	1
out	1
his	1
chest	1
he	1
waddled	1
slowly	1
away.	1
Mrs.	1
Small	1
and	1
Aunt	1
Hester	1
were	1
left	1
horrified.	1
Swithin	1
was	1
so	1
droll!	1
They	1
themselves	1
were	1
longing	1
to	1
ask	1
Soames	1
how	1
Irene	1
would	1
take	1
the	1
result,	1
yet	1
knew	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
not;	1
he	1
would	1
perhaps	1
say	1
something	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
accord,	1
to	1
throw	1
some	1
light	1
on	1
this,	1
the	1
present	1
burning	1
question	1
in	1
their	1
lives,	1
the	1
question	1
that	1
from	1
necessity	1
of	1
silence	1
tortured	1
them	1
almost	1
beyond	1
bearing;	1
for	1
even	1
Timothy	1
had	1
now	1
been	1
told,	1
and	1
the	1
effect	1
on	1
his	1
health	1
was	1
little	1
short	1
of	1
alarming.	1
And	1
what,	1
too,	1
would	1
June	1
do?	1
This,	1
also,	1
was	1
a	1
most	1
exciting,	1
if	1
dangerous	1
speculation!	1
They	1
had	1
never	1
forgotten	1
old	1
Jolyon’s	1
visit,	1
since	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
once	1
been	1
to	1
see	1
them;	1
they	1
had	1
never	1
forgotten	1
the	1
feeling	1
it	1
gave	1
all	1
who	1
were	1
present,	1
that	1
the	1
family	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
what	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
—	1
that	1
the	1
family	1
was	1
breaking	1
up.	1
But	1
Soames	1
gave	1
them	1
no	1
help,	1
sitting	1
with	1
his	1
knees	1
crossed,	1
talking	1
of	1
the	1
Barbizon	1
school	1
of	1
painters,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
discovered.	1
These	1
were	1
the	1
coming	1
men,	1
he	1
said;	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
wonder	1
if	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
money	1
were	1
made	1
over	1
them;	1
he	1
had	1
his	1
eye	1
on	1
two	1
pictures	1
by	1
a	1
man	1
called	1
Corot,	1
charming	1
things;	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
get	1
them	1
at	1
a	1
reasonable	1
price	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
buy	1
them	1
—	1
they	1
would,	1
he	1
thought,	1
fetch	1
a	1
big	1
price	1
some	1
day.	1
Interested	1
as	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
be,	1
neither	1
Mrs.	1
Septimus	1
Small	1
nor	1
Aunt	1
Hester	1
could	1
entirely	1
acquiesce	1
in	1
being	1
thus	1
put	1
off.	1
It	1
was	1
interesting	1
—	1
most	1
interesting	1
—	1
and	1
then	1
Soames	1
was	1
so	1
clever	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
sure	1
he	1
would	1
do	1
something	1
with	1
those	1
pictures	1
if	1
anybody	1
could;	1
but	1
what	1
was	1
his	1
plan	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
won	1
his	1
case;	1
was	1
he	1
going	1
to	1
leave	1
London	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
country,	1
or	1
what	1
was	1
he	1
going	1
to	1
do?	1
Soames	1
answered	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know,	1
he	1
thought	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
moving	1
soon.	1
He	1
rose	1
and	1
kissed	1
his	1
aunts.	1
No	1
sooner	1
had	1
Aunt	1
Juley	1
received	1
this	1
emblem	1
of	1
departure	1
than	1
a	1
change	1
came	1
over	1
her,	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
were	1
being	1
visited	1
by	1
dreadful	1
courage;	1
every	1
little	1
roll	1
of	1
flesh	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
seemed	1
trying	1
to	1
escape	1
from	1
an	1
invisible,	1
confining	1
mask.	1
She	1
rose	1
to	1
the	1
full	1
extent	1
of	1
her	1
more	1
than	1
medium	1
height,	1
and	1
said:	1
“It	1
has	1
been	1
on	1
my	1
mind	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
dear,	1
and	1
if	1
nobody	1
else	1
will	1
tell	1
you,	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
up	1
my	1
mind	1
that.	1
.	3
”	1
Aunt	1
Hester	1
interrupted	1
her:	1
“Mind,	1
Julia,	1
you	1
do	1
it.	1
.	3
”	1
she	1
gasped	1
—“on	1
your	1
own	1
responsibility!”	1
Mrs.	1
Small	1
went	1
on	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
heard:	1
“I	1
think	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
know,	1
dear,	1
that	1
Mrs.	1
MacAnder	1
saw	1
Irene	1
walking	1
in	1
Richmond	1
Park	1
with	1
Mr.	1
Bosinney.”	1
Aunt	1
Hester,	1
who	1
had	1
also	1
risen,	1
sank	1
back	1
in	1
her	1
chair,	1
and	1
turned	1
her	1
face	1
away.	1
Really	1
Juley	1
was	1
too	1
—	1
she	1
should	1
not	1
do	1
such	1
things	1
when	1
she	1
—	1
Aunt	1
Hester,	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
room;	1
and,	1
breathless	1
with	1
anticipation,	1
she	1
waited	1
for	1
what	1
Soames	1
would	1
answer.	1
He	1
had	1
flushed	1
the	1
peculiar	1
flush	1
which	1
always	1
centred	1
between	1
his	1
eyes;	1
lifting	1
his	1
hand,	1
and,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
selecting	1
a	1
finger,	1
he	1
bit	1
a	1
nail	1
delicately;	1
then,	1
drawling	1
it	1
out	1
between	1
set	1
lips,	1
he	1
said:	1
“Mrs.	1
MacAnder	1
is	1
a	1
cat!”	1
Without	1
waiting	1
for	1
any	1
reply,	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
When	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
Timothy’s	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
what	1
course	1
to	1
pursue	1
on	1
getting	1
home.	1
He	1
would	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
Irene	1
and	1
say:	1
“Well,	1
I’ve	1
won	1
my	1
case,	1
and	1
there’s	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
it!	1
I	1
don’t	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
hard	1
on	1
Bosinney;	1
I’ll	1
see	1
if	1
we	1
can’t	1
come	1
to	1
some	1
arrangement;	1
he	1
shan’t	1
be	1
pressed.	1
And	1
now	1
let’s	1
turn	1
over	1
a	1
new	1
leaf!	1
We’ll	1
let	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
these	1
fogs.	1
We’ll	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
Robin	1
Hill	1
at	1
once.	1
I—	1
I	1
never	1
meant	1
to	1
be	1
rough	1
with	1
you!	1
Let’s	1
shake	1
hands	1
—	1
and	1
—”	1
Perhaps	1
she	1
would	1
let	1
him	1
kiss	1
her,	1
and	1
forget!	1
When	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
Timothy’s	1
his	1
intentions	1
were	1
no	1
longer	1
so	1
simple.	1
The	1
smouldering	1
jealousy	1
and	1
suspicion	1
of	1
months	1
blazed	1
up	1
within	1
him.	1
He	1
would	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
thing	1
once	1
and	1
for	1
all;	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
her	1
drag	1
his	1
name	1
in	1
the	1
dirt!	1
If	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
or	1
would	1
not	1
love	1
him,	1
as	1
was	1
her	1
duty	1
and	1
his	1
right	1
—	1
she	1
should	1
not	1
play	1
him	1
tricks	1
with	1
anyone	1
else!	1
He	1
would	1
tax	1
her	1
with	1
it;	1
threaten	1
to	1
divorce	1
her!	1
That	1
would	1
make	1
her	1
behave;	1
she	1
would	1
never	1
face	1
that.	1
But	1
—	1
but	1
—	1
what	1
if	1
she	1
did?	1
He	1
was	1
staggered;	1
this	1
had	1
not	1
occurred	1
to	1
him.	1
What	1
if	1
she	1
did?	1
What	1
if	1
she	1
made	1
him	1
a	1
confession?	1
How	1
would	1
he	1
stand	1
then?	1
He	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
bring	1
a	1
divorce!	1
A	1
divorce!	1
Thus	1
close,	1
the	1
word	1
was	1
paralyzing,	1
so	1
utterly	1
at	1
variance	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
principles	1
that	1
had	1
hitherto	1
guided	1
his	1
life.	1
Its	1
lack	1
of	1
compromise	1
appalled	1
him;	1
he	1
felt	1
—	1
like	1
the	1
captain	1
of	1
a	1
ship,	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
vessel,	1
and,	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
hands	1
throwing	1
over	1
the	1
most	1
precious	1
of	1
his	1
bales.	1
This	1
jettisoning	1
of	1
his	1
property	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
hand	1
seemed	1
uncanny	1
to	1
Soames.	1
It	1
would	1
injure	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
profession:	1
He	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
at	1
Robin	1
Hill,	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
spent	1
so	1
much	1
money,	1
so	1
much	1
anticipation	1
—	1
and	1
at	1
a	1
sacrifice.	1
And	1
she!	1
She	1
would	1
no	1
longer	1
belong	1
to	1
him,	1
not	1
even	1
in	1
name!	1
She	1
would	1
pass	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
life,	1
and	1
he	1
—	1
he	1
should	1
never	1
see	1
her	1
again!	1
He	1
traversed	1
in	1
the	1
cab	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
a	1
street	1
without	1
getting	1
beyond	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
never	1
see	1
her	1
again!	1
But	1
perhaps	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
confess,	1
even	1
now	1
very	1
likely	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
confess.	1
Was	1
it	1
wise	1
to	1
push	1
things	1
so	1
far?	1
Was	1
it	1
wise	1
to	1
put	1
himself	1
into	1
a	1
position	1
where	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
to	1
eat	1
his	1
words?	1
The	1
result	1
of	1
this	1
case	1
would	1
ruin	1
Bosinney;	1
a	1
ruined	1
man	1
was	1
desperate,	1
but	1
—	1
what	1
could	1
he	1
do?	1
He	1
might	1
go	1
abroad,	1
ruined	1
men	1
always	1
went	1
abroad.	1
What	1
could	1
they	1
do	1
—	1
if	1
indeed	1
it	1
was	1
‘they’—	1
without	1
money?	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
to	1
wait	1
and	1
see	1
how	1
things	1
turned	1
out.	1
If	1
necessary,	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
her	1
watched.	1
The	1
agony	1
of	1
his	1
jealousy	1
(for	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
like	1
the	1
crisis	1
of	1
an	1
aching	1
tooth)	1
came	1
on	1
again;	1
and	1
he	1
almost	1
cried	1
out.	1
But	1
he	1
must	1
decide,	1
fix	1
on	1
some	1
course	1
of	1
action	1
before	1
he	1
got	1
home.	1
When	1
the	1
cab	1
drew	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
he	1
had	1
decided	1
nothing.	1
He	1
entered,	1
pale,	1
his	1
hands	1
moist	1
with	1
perspiration,	1
dreading	1
to	1
meet	1
her,	1
burning	1
to	1
meet	1
her,	1
ignorant	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
say	1
or	1
do.	1
The	1
maid	1
Bilson	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
hall,	1
and	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
his	1
question:	1
“Where	1
is	1
your	1
mistress?”	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
Mrs.	1
Forsyte	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
house	1
about	1
noon,	1
taking	1
with	1
her	1
a	1
trunk	1
and	1
bag.	1
Snatching	1
the	1
sleeve	1
of	1
his	1
fur	1
coat	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
grasp,	1
he	1
confronted	1
her:	1
“What?”	1
he	1
exclaimed;	1
“what’s	1
that	1
you	1
said?”	1
Suddenly	1
recollecting	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
not	1
betray	1
emotion,	1
he	1
added:	1
“What	1
message	1
did	1
she	1
leave?”	1
and	1
noticed	1
with	1
secret	1
terror	1
the	1
startled	1
look	1
of	1
the	1
maid’s	1
eyes.	1
“Mrs.	1
Forsyte	1
left	1
no	1
message,	1
sir.”	1
“No	1
message;	1
very	1
well,	1
thank	1
you,	1
that	1
will	1
do.	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
dining	1
out.”	1
The	1
maid	1
went	1
downstairs,	1
leaving	1
him	1
still	1
in	1
his	1
fur	1
coat,	1
idly	1
turning	1
over	1
the	1
visiting	1
cards	1
in	1
the	1
porcelain	1
bowl	1
that	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
carved	1
oak	1
rug	1
chest	1
in	1
the	1
hall.	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Bareham	1
Culcher.	1
Mrs.	1
Septimus	1
Small.	1
Mrs.	1
Baynes.	1
Mr.	1
Solomon	1
Thornworthy.	1
Lady	1
Bellis.	1
Miss	1
Hermione	1
Bellis.	1
Miss	1
Winifred	1
Bellis.	1
Miss	1
Ella	1
Bellis.	1
Who	1
the	1
devil	1
were	1
all	1
these	1
people?	1
He	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
forgotten	1
all	1
familiar	1
things.	1
The	1
words	1
‘no	1
message	1
—	1
a	1
trunk,	1
and	1
a	1
bag,’	1
played	1
a	1
hide-and-seek	1
in	1
his	1
brain.	1
It	1
was	1
incredible	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
left	1
no	1
message,	1
and,	1
still	1
in	1
his	1
fur	1
coat,	1
he	1
ran	1
upstairs	1
two	1
steps	1
at	1
a	1
time,	1
as	1
a	1
young	1
married	1
man	1
when	1
he	1
comes	1
home	1
will	1
run	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
wife’s	1
room.	1
Everything	1
was	1
dainty,	1
fresh,	1
sweet-smelling;	1
everything	1
in	1
perfect	1
order.	1
On	1
the	1
great	1
bed	1
with	1
its	1
lilac	1
silk	1
quilt,	1
was	1
the	1
bag	1
she	1
had	1
made	1
and	1
embroidered	1
with	1
her	1
own	1
hands	1
to	1
hold	1
her	1
sleeping	1
things;	1
her	1
slippers	1
ready	1
at	1
the	1
foot;	1
the	1
sheets	1
even	1
turned	1
over	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
as	1
though	1
expecting	1
her.	1
On	1
the	1
table	1
stood	1
the	1
silver-mounted	1
brushes	1
and	1
bottles	1
from	1
her	1
dressing	1
bag,	1
his	1
own	1
present.	1
There	1
must,	1
then,	1
be	1
some	1
mistake.	1
What	1
bag	1
had	1
she	1
taken?	1
He	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
bell	1
to	1
summon	1
Bilson,	1
but	1
remembered	1
in	1
time	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
assume	1
knowledge	1
of	1
where	1
Irene	1
had	1
gone,	1
take	1
it	1
all	1
as	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
course,	1
and	1
grope	1
out	1
the	1
meaning	1
for	1
himself.	1
He	1
locked	1
the	1
doors,	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
think,	1
but	1
felt	1
his	1
brain	1
going	1
round;	1
and	1
suddenly	1
tears	1
forced	1
themselves	1
into	1
his	1
eyes.	1
Hurriedly	1
pulling	1
off	1
his	1
coat,	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
mirror.	1
He	1
was	1
too	1
pale,	1
a	1
greyish	1
tinge	1
all	1
over	1
his	1
face;	1
he	1
poured	1
out	1
water,	1
and	1
began	1
feverishly	1
washing.	1
Her	1
silver-mounted	1
brushes	1
smelt	1
faintly	1
of	1
the	1
perfumed	1
lotion	1
she	1
used	1
for	1
her	1
hair;	1
and	1
at	1
this	1
scent	1
the	1
burning	1
sickness	1
of	1
his	1
jealousy	1
seized	1
him	1
again.	1
Struggling	1
into	1
his	1
fur,	1
he	1
ran	1
downstairs	1
and	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
street.	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
lost	1
all	1
command	1
of	1
himself,	1
however,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
down	1
Sloane	1
Street	1
he	1
framed	1
a	1
story	1
for	1
use,	1
in	1
case	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
find	1
her	1
at	1
Bosinney’s.	1
But	1
if	1
he	1
should?	1
His	1
power	1
of	1
decision	1
again	1
failed;	1
he	1
reached	1
the	1
house	1
without	1
knowing	1
what	1
he	1
should	1
do	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
find	1
her	1
there.	1
It	1
was	1
after	1
office	1
hours,	1
and	1
the	1
street	1
door	1
was	1
closed;	1
the	1
woman	1
who	1
opened	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
say	1
whether	1
Mr.	1
Bosinney	1
were	1
in	1
or	1
no;	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
him	1
that	1
day,	1
not	1
for	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
days;	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
attend	1
to	1
him	1
now,	1
nobody	1
attended	1
to	1
him,	1
he.	1
.	3
Soames	1
interrupted	1
her,	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
up	1
and	1
see	1
for	1
himself.	1
He	1
went	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
dogged,	1
white	1
face.	1
The	1
top	1
floor	1
was	1
unlighted,	1
the	1
door	1
closed,	1
no	1
one	1
answered	1
his	1
ringing,	1
he	1
could	1
hear	1
no	1
sound.	1
He	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
descend,	1
shivering	1
under	1
his	1
fur,	1
a	1
chill	1
at	1
his	1
heart.	1
Hailing	1
a	1
cab,	1
he	1
told	1
the	1
man	1
to	1
drive	1
to	1
Park	1
Lane.	1
On	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
recollect	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
last	1
given	1
her	1
a	1
cheque;	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
more	1
than	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
pounds,	1
but	1
there	1
were	1
her	1
jewels;	1
and	1
with	1
exquisite	1
torture	1
he	1
remembered	1
how	1
much	1
money	1
she	1
could	1
raise	1
on	1
these;	1
enough	1
to	1
take	1
them	1
abroad;	1
enough	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
live	1
on	1
for	1
months!	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
calculate;	1
the	1
cab	1
stopped,	1
and	1
he	1
got	1
out	1
with	1
the	1
calculation	1
unmade.	1
The	1
butler	1
asked	1
whether	1
Mrs.	1
Soames	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
cab,	1
the	1
master	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
expected	1
to	1
dinner.	1
Soames	1
answered:	1
“No.	1
Mrs.	1
Forsyte	1
has	1
a	1
cold.”	1
The	1
butler	1
was	1
sorry.	1
Soames	1
thought	1
he	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
inquisitively,	1
and	1
remembering	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
dress	1
clothes,	1
asked:	1
“Anybody	1
here	1
to	1
dinner,	1
Warmson?”	1
“Nobody	1
but	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Dartie,	1
sir.”	1
Again	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Soames	1
that	1
the	1
butler	1
was	1
looking	1
curiously	1
at	1
him.	1
His	1
composure	1
gave	1
way.	1
“What	1
are	1
you	1
looking	1
at?”	1
he	1
said.	1
“What’s	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
me,	1
eh?”	1
The	1
butler	1
blushed,	1
hung	1
up	1
the	1
fur	1
coat,	1
murmured	1
something	1
that	1
sounded	1
like:	1
“Nothing,	1
sir,	1
I’m	1
sure,	1
sir,”	1
and	1
stealthily	1
withdrew.	1
Soames	1
walked	1
upstairs.	1
Passing	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
without	1
a	1
look,	1
he	1
went	1
straight	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
mother’s	1
and	1
father’s	1
bedroom.	1
James,	1
standing	1
sideways,	1
the	1
concave	1
lines	1
of	1
his	1
tall,	1
lean	1
figure	1
displayed	1
to	1
advantage	1
in	1
shirt-sleeves	1
and	1
evening	1
waistcoat,	1
his	1
head	1
bent,	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
his	1
white	1
tie	1
peeping	1
askew	1
from	1
underneath	1
one	1
white	1
Dundreary	1
whisker,	1
his	1
eyes	1
peering	1
with	1
intense	1
concentration,	1
his	1
lips	1
pouting,	1
was	1
hooking	1
the	1
top	1
hooks	1
of	1
his	1
wife’s	1
bodice.	1
Soames	1
stopped;	1
he	1
felt	1
half-choked,	1
whether	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
upstairs	1
too	1
fast,	1
or	1
for	1
some	1
other	1
reason.	1
He	1
—	1
he	1
himself	1
had	1
never	1
—	1
never	1
been	1
asked	1
to.	1
.	3
He	1
heard	1
his	1
father’s	1
voice,	1
as	1
though	1
there	1
were	1
a	1
pin	1
in	1
his	1
mouth,	1
saying:	1
“Who’s	1
that?	1
Who’s	1
there?	1
What	1
d’you	1
want?”	1
His	1
mother’s:	1
“Here,	1
Felice,	1
come	1
and	1
hook	1
this;	1
your	1
master’ll	1
never	1
get	1
done.”	1
He	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
throat,	1
and	1
said	1
hoarsely:	1
“It’s	1
I—	1
Soames!”	1
He	1
noticed	1
gratefully	1
the	1
affectionate	1
surprise	1
in	1
Emily’s:	1
“Well,	1
my	1
dear	1
boy?”	1
and	1
James’,	1
as	1
he	1
dropped	1
the	1
hook:	1
“What,	1
Soames!	1
What’s	1
brought	1
you	1
up?	1
Aren’t	1
you	1
well?”	1
He	1
answered	1
mechanically:	1
“I’m	1
all	1
right,”	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
them,	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
impossible	1
to	1
bring	1
out	1
his	1
news.	1
James,	1
quick	1
to	1
take	1
alarm,	1
began:	1
“You	1
don’t	1
look	1
well.	1
I	1
expect	1
you’ve	1
taken	1
a	1
chill	1
—	1
it’s	1
liver,	1
I	1
shouldn’t	1
wonder.	1
Your	1
mother’ll	1
give	1
you.	1
.	3
”	1
But	1
Emily	1
broke	1
in	1
quietly:	1
“Have	1
you	1
brought	1
Irene?”	1
Soames	1
shook	1
his	1
head.	1
“No,”	1
he	1
stammered,	1
“she	1
—	1
she’s	1
left	1
me!”	1
Emily	1
deserted	1
the	1
mirror	1
before	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
standing.	1
Her	1
tall,	1
full	1
figure	1
lost	1
its	1
majesty	1
and	1
became	1
very	1
human	1
as	1
she	1
came	1
running	1
over	1
to	1
Soames.	1
“My	1
dear	1
boy!	1
My	1
dear	1
boy!”	1
She	1
put	1
her	1
lips	1
to	1
his	1
forehead,	1
and	1
stroked	1
his	1
hand.	1
James,	1
too,	1
had	1
turned	1
full	1
towards	1
his	1
son;	1
his	1
face	1
looked	1
older.	1
“Left	1
you?”	1
he	1
said.	1
“What	1
d’you	1
mean	1
—	1
left	1
you?	1
You	1
never	1
told	1
me	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
leave	1
you.”	1
Soames	1
answered	1
surlily:	1
“How	1
could	1
I	1
tell?	1
What’s	1
to	1
be	1
done?”	1
James	1
began	1
walking	1
up	1
and	1
down;	1
he	1
looked	1
strange	1
and	1
stork-like	1
without	1
a	1
coat.	1
“What’s	1
to	1
be	1
done!”	1
he	1
muttered.	1
“How	1
should	1
I	1
know	1
what’s	1
to	1
be	1
done?	1
What’s	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
asking	1
me?	1
Nobody	1
tells	1
me	1
anything,	1
and	1
then	1
they	1
come	1
and	1
ask	1
me	1
what’s	1
to	1
be	1
done;	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
know	1
how	1
I’m	1
to	1
tell	1
them!	1
Here’s	1
your	1
mother,	1
there	1
she	1
stands;	1
she	1
doesn’t	1
say	1
anything.	1
What	1
I	1
should	1
say	1
you’ve	1
got	1
to	1
do	1
is	1
to	1
follow	1
her..”	1
Soames	1
smiled;	1
his	1
peculiar,	1
supercilious	1
smile	1
had	1
never	1
before	1
looked	1
pitiable.	1
“I	1
don’t	1
know	1
where	1
she’s	1
gone,”	1
he	1
said.	1
“Don’t	1
know	1
where	1
she’s	1
gone!”	1
said	1
James.	1
“How	1
d’you	1
mean,	1
don’t	1
know	1
where	1
she’s	1
gone?	1
Where	1
d’you	1
suppose	1
she’s	1
gone?	1
She’s	1
gone	1
after	1
that	1
young	1
Bosinney,	1
that’s	1
where	1
she’s	1
gone.	1
I	1
knew	1
how	1
it	1
would	1
be.”	1
Soames,	1
in	1
the	1
long	1
silence	1
that	1
followed,	1
felt	1
his	1
mother	1
pressing	1
his	1
hand.	1
And	1
all	1
that	1
passed	1
seemed	1
to	1
pass	1
as	1
though	1
his	1
own	1
power	1
of	1
thinking	1
or	1
doing	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
sleep.	1
His	1
father’s	1
face,	1
dusky	1
red,	1
twitching	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
going	1
to	1
cry,	1
and	1
words	1
breaking	1
out	1
that	1
seemed	1
rent	1
from	1
him	1
by	1
some	1
spasm	1
in	1
his	1
soul.	1
“There’ll	1
be	1
a	1
scandal;	1
I	1
always	1
said	1
so.”	1
Then,	1
no	1
one	1
saying	1
anything:	1
“And	1
there	1
you	1
stand,	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
mother!”	1
And	1
Emily’s	1
voice,	1
calm,	1
rather	1
contemptuous:	1
“Come,	1
now,	1
James!	1
Soames	1
will	1
do	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
can.”	1
And	1
James,	1
staring	1
at	1
the	1
floor,	1
a	1
little	1
brokenly:	1
“Well,	1
I	1
can’t	1
help	1
you;	1
I’m	1
getting	1
old.	1
Don’t	1
you	1
be	1
in	1
too	1
great	1
a	1
hurry,	1
my	1
boy.”	1
And	1
his	1
mother’s	1
voice	1
again:	1
“Soames	1
will	1
do	1
all	1
he	1
can	1
to	1
get	1
her	1
back.	1
We	1
won’t	1
talk	1
of	1
it.	1
It’ll	1
all	1
come	1
right,	1
I	1
dare	1
say.”	1
And	1
James:	1
“Well,	1
I	1
can’t	1
see	1
how	1
it	1
can	1
come	1
right.	1
And	1
if	1
she	1
hasn’t	1
gone	1
off	1
with	1
that	1
young	1
Bosinney,	1
my	1
advice	1
to	1
you	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
her,	1
but	1
to	1
follow	1
her	1
and	1
get	1
her	1
back.”	1
Once	1
more	1
Soames	1
felt	1
his	1
mother	1
stroking	1
his	1
hand,	1
in	1
token	1
of	1
her	1
approval,	1
and	1
as	1
though	1
repeating	1
some	1
form	1
of	1
sacred	1
oath,	1
he	1
muttered	1
between	1
his	1
teeth:	1
“I	1
will!”	1
All	1
three	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
together.	1
There,	1
were	1
gathered	1
the	1
three	1
girls	1
and	1
Dartie;	1
had	1
Irene	1
been	1
present,	1
the	1
family	1
circle	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
complete.	1
James	1
sank	1
into	1
his	1
armchair,	1
and	1
except	1
for	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
cold	1
greeting	1
to	1
Dartie,	1
whom	1
he	1
both	1
despised	1
and	1
dreaded,	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
always	1
in	1
want	1
of	1
money,	1
he	1
said	1
nothing	1
till	1
dinner	1
was	1
announced.	1
Soames,	1
too,	1
was	1
silent;	1
Emily	1
alone,	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
cool	1
courage,	1
maintained	1
a	1
conversation	1
with	1
Winifred	1
on	1
trivial	1
subjects.	1
She	1
was	1
never	1
more	1
composed	1
in	1
her	1
manner	1
and	1
conversation	1
than	1
that	1
evening.	1
A	1
decision	1
having	1
been	1
come	1
to	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
Irene’s	1
flight,	1
no	1
view	1
was	1
expressed	1
by	1
any	1
other	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
course	1
to	1
be	1
pursued;	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
little	1
doubt,	1
from	1
the	1
general	1
tone	1
adopted	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
events	1
as	1
they	1
afterwards	1
turned	1
out,	1
that	1
James’s	1
advice:	1
“Don’t	1
you	1
listen	1
to	1
her,	1
follow-her	1
and	1
get	1
her	1
back!”	1
would,	1
with	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
an	1
exception,	1
have	1
been	1
regarded	1
as	1
sound,	1
not	1
only	1
in	1
Park	1
Lane,	1
but	1
amongst	1
the	1
Nicholases,	1
the	1
Rogers,	1
and	1
at	1
Timothy’s.	1
Just	1
as	1
it	1
would	1
surely	1
have	1
been	1
endorsed	1
by	1
that	1
wider	1
body	1
of	1
Forsytes	1
all	1
over	1
London,	1
who	1
were	1
merely	1
excluded	1
from	1
judgment	1
by	1
ignorance	1
of	1
the	1
story.	1
In	1
spite	1
then	1
of	1
Emily’s	1
efforts,	1
the	1
dinner	1
was	1
served	1
by	1
Warmson	1
and	1
the	1
footman	1
almost	1
in	1
silence.	1
Dartie	1
was	1
sulky,	1
and	1
drank	1
all	1
he	1
could	1
get;	1
the	1
girls	1
seldom	1
talked	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
at	1
any	1
time.	1
James	1
asked	1
once	1
where	1
June	1
was,	1
and	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
doing	1
with	1
herself	1
in	1
these	1
days.	1
No	1
one	1
could	1
tell	1
him.	1
He	1
sank	1
back	1
into	1
gloom.	1
Only	1
when	1
Winifred	1
recounted	1
how	1
little	1
Publius	1
had	1
given	1
his	1
bad	1
penny	1
to	1
a	1
beggar,	1
did	1
he	1
brighten	1
up.	1
“Ah!”	1
he	1
said,	1
“that’s	1
a	1
clever	1
little	1
chap.	1
I	1
don’t	1
know	1
what’ll	1
become	1
of	1
him,	1
if	1
he	1
goes	1
on	1
like	1
this.	1
An	1
intelligent	1
little	1
chap,	1
I	1
call	1
him!”	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
flash.	1
The	1
courses	1
succeeded	1
one	1
another	1
solemnly,	1
under	1
the	1
electric	1
light,	1
which	1
glared	1
down	1
onto	1
the	1
table,	1
but	1
barely	1
reached	1
the	1
principal	1
ornament	1
of	1
the	1
walls,	1
a	1
so-called	1
‘Sea	1
Piece	1
by	1
Turner,’	1
almost	1
entirely	1
composed	1
of	1
cordage	1
and	1
drowning	1
men.	1
Champagne	1
was	1
handed,	1
and	1
then	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
James’	1
prehistoric	1
port,	1
but	1
as	1
by	1
the	1
chill	1
hand	1
of	1
some	1
skeleton.	1
At	1
ten	1
o’clock	1
Soames	1
left;	1
twice	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
questions,	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
that	1
Irene	1
was	1
not	1
well;	1
he	1
felt	1
he	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
trust	1
himself.	1
His	1
mother	1
kissed	1
him	1
with	1
her	1
large	1
soft	1
kiss,	1
and	1
he	1
pressed	1
her	1
hand,	1
a	1
flush	1
of	1
warmth	1
in	1
his	1
cheeks.	1
He	1
walked	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
cold	1
wind,	1
which	1
whistled	1
desolately	1
round	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
the	1
streets,	1
under	1
a	1
sky	1
of	1
clear	1
steel-blue,	1
alive	1
with	1
stars;	1
he	1
noticed	1
neither	1
their	1
frosty	1
greeting,	1
nor	1
the	1
crackle	1
of	1
the	1
curled-up	1
plane-leaves,	1
nor	1
the	1
night-women	1
hurrying	1
in	1
their	1
shabby	1
furs,	1
nor	1
the	1
pinched	1
faces	1
of	1
vagabonds	1
at	1
street	1
corners.	1
Winter	1
was	1
come!	1
But	1
Soames	1
hastened	1
home,	1
oblivious;	1
his	1
hands	1
trembled	1
as	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
late	1
letters	1
from	1
the	1
gilt	1
wire	1
cage	1
into	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
thrust	1
through	1
the	1
slit	1
in	1
the	1
door.’	1
None	1
from	1
Irene!	1
He	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
dining-room;	1
the	1
fire	1
was	1
bright	1
there,	1
his	1
chair	1
drawn	1
up	1
to	1
it,	1
slippers	1
ready,	1
spirit	1
case,	1
and	1
carven	1
cigarette	1
box	1
on	1
the	1
table;	1
but	1
after	1
staring	1
at	1
it	1
all	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
or	1
two,	1
he	1
turned	1
out	1
the	1
light	1
and	1
went	1
upstairs.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
fire	1
too	1
in	1
his	1
dressing-room,	1
but	1
her	1
room	1
was	1
dark	1
and	1
cold.	1
It	1
was	1
into	1
this	1
room	1
that	1
Soames	1
went.	1
He	1
made	1
a	1
great	1
illumination	1
with	1
candles,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
continued	1
pacing	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
between	1
the	1
bed	1
and	1
the	1
door.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
get	1
used	1
to	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
really	1
left	1
him,	1
and	1
as	1
though	1
still	1
searching	1
for	1
some	1
message,	1
some	1
reason,	1
some	1
reading	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
his	1
married	1
life,	1
he	1
began	1
opening	1
every	1
recess	1
and	1
drawer.	1
There	1
were	1
her	1
dresses;	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
liked,	1
indeed	1
insisted,	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
be	1
well-dressed	1
—	1
she	1
had	1
taken	1
very	1
few;	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
at	1
most,	1
and	1
drawer	1
after	1
drawer;	1
full	1
of	1
linen	1
and	1
silk	1
things,	1
was	1
untouched.	1
Perhaps	1
after	1
all	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
freak,	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
the	1
seaside	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
days’	1
change.	1
If	1
only	1
that	1
were	1
so,	1
and	1
she	1
were	1
really	1
coming	1
back,	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
again	1
do	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
that	1
fatal	1
night	1
before	1
last,	1
never	1
again	1
run	1
that	1
risk	1
—	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
her	1
duty,	1
her	1
duty	1
as	1
a	1
wife;	1
though	1
she	1
did	1
belong	1
to	1
him	1
—	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
again	1
run	1
that	1
risk;	1
she	1
was	1
evidently	1
not	1
quite	1
right	1
in	1
her	1
head!	1
He	1
stooped	1
over	1
the	1
drawer	1
where	1
she	1
kept	1
her	1
jewels;	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
locked,	1
and	1
came	1
open	1
as	1
he	1
pulled;	1
the	1
jewel	1
box	1
had	1
the	1
key	1
in	1
it.	1
This	1
surprised	1
him	1
until	1
he	1
remembered	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
sure	1
to	1
be	1
empty.	1
He	1
opened	1
it.	1
It	1
was	1
far	1
from	1
empty.	1
Divided,	1
in	1
little	1
green	1
velvet	1
compartments,	1
were	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
her,	1
even	1
her	1
watch,	1
and	1
stuck	1
into	1
the	1
recess	1
that	1
contained	1
—	1
the	1
watch	1
was	1
a	1
three-cornered	1
note	1
addressed	1
‘Soames	1
Forsyte,’	1
in	1
Irene’s	1
handwriting:	1
‘I	1
think	1
I	1
have	1
taken	1
nothing	1
that	1
you	1
or	1
your	1
people	1
have	1
given	1
me.’	1
And	1
that	1
was	1
all.	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
clasps	1
and	1
bracelets	1
of	1
diamonds	1
and	1
pearls,	1
at	1
the	1
little	1
flat	1
gold	1
watch	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
diamond	1
set	1
in	1
sapphires,	1
at	1
the	1
chains	1
and	1
rings,	1
each	1
in	1
its	1
nest,	1
and	1
the	1
tears	1
rushed	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
dropped	1
upon	1
them.	1
Nothing	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
have	1
done,	1
nothing	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
done,	1
brought	1
home	1
to	1
him	1
like	1
this	1
the	1
inner	1
significance	1
of	1
her	1
act.	1
For	1
the	1
moment,	1
perhaps,	1
he	1
understood	1
nearly	1
all	1
there	1
was	1
to	1
understand	1
—	1
understood	1
that	1
she	1
loathed	1
him,	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
loathed	1
him	1
for	1
years,	1
that	1
for	1
all	1
intents	1
and	1
purposes	1
they	1
were	1
like	1
people	1
living	1
in	1
different	1
worlds,	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
hope	1
for	1
him,	1
never	1
had	1
been;	1
even,	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
suffered	1
—	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
pitied.	1
In	1
that	1
moment	1
of	1
emotion	1
he	1
betrayed	1
the	1
Forsyte	1
in	1
him	1
—	1
forgot	1
himself,	1
his	1
interests,	1
his	1
property	1
—	1
was	1
capable	1
of	1
almost	1
anything;	1
was	1
lifted	1
into	1
the	1
pure	1
ether	1
of	1
the	1
selfless	1
and	1
unpractical.	1
Such	1
moments	1
pass	1
quickly.	1
And	1
as	1
though	1
with	1
the	1
tears	1
he	1
had	1
purged	1
himself	1
of	1
weakness,	1
he	1
got	1
up,	1
locked	1
the	1
box,	1
and	1
slowly,	1
almost	1
trembling,	1
carried	1
it	1
with	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
other	1
room.	1
Chapter	1
30	1
June’s	1
Victory	1
June	1
had	1
waited	1
for	1
her	1
chance,	1
scanning	1
the	1
duller	1
columns	1
of	1
the	1
journals,	1
morning	1
and	1
evening	1
with	1
an	1
assiduity	1
which	1
at	1
first	1
puzzled	1
old	1
Jolyon;	1
and	1
when	1
her	1
chance	1
came,	1
she	1
took	1
it	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
promptitude	1
and	1
resolute	1
tenacity	1
of	1
her	1
character.	1
She	1
will	1
always	1
remember	1
best	1
in	1
her	1
life	1
that	1
morning	1
when	1
at	1
last	1
she	1
saw	1
amongst	1
the	1
reliable	1
Cause	1
List	1
of	1
the	1
Times	1
newspaper,	1
under	1
the	1
heading	1
of	1
Court	1
XIII,	1
Mr.	1
Justice	1
Bentham,	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
Forsyte	1
v.	1
Bosinney.	1
Like	1
a	1
gambler	1
who	1
stakes	1
his	1
last	1
piece	1
of	1
money,	1
she	1
had	1
prepared	1
to	1
hazard	1
her	1
all	1
upon	1
this	1
throw;	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
her	1
nature	1
to	1
contemplate	1
defeat.	1
How,	1
unless	1
with	1
the	1
instinct	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
in	1
love,	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
Bosinney’s	1
discomfiture	1
in	1
this	1
action	1
was	1
assured,	1
cannot	1
be	1
told	1
—	1
on	1
this	1
assumption,	1
however,	1
she	1
laid	1
her	1
plans,	1
as	1
upon	1
a	1
certainty.	1
Half	1
past	1
eleven	1
found	1
her	1
at	1
watch	1
in	1
the	1
gallery	1
of	1
Court	1
XIII.,	1
and	1
there	1
she	1
remained	1
till	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
Forsyte	1
v.	1
Bosinney	1
was	1
over.	1
Bosinney’s	1
absence	1
did	1
not	1
disquiet	1
her;	1
she	1
had	1
felt	1
instinctively	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
defend	1
himself.	1
At	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
judgment	1
she	1
hastened	1
down,	1
and	1
took	1
a	1
cab	1
to	1
his	1
rooms.	1
She	1
passed	1
the	1
open	1
street-door	1
and	1
the	1
offices	1
on	1
the	1
three	1
lower	1
floors	1
without	1
attracting	1
notice;	1
not	1
till	1
she	1
reached	1
the	1
top	1
did	1
her	1
difficulties	1
begin.	1
Her	1
ring	1
was	1
not	1
answered;	1
she	1
had	1
now	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
her	1
mind	1
whether	1
she	1
would	1
go	1
down	1
and	1
ask	1
the	1
caretaker	1
in	1
the	1
basement	1
to	1
let	1
her	1
in	1
to	1
await	1
Mr.	1
Bosinney’s	1
return,	1
or	1
remain	1
patiently	1
outside	1
the	1
door,	1
trusting	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
would,	1
come	1
up.	1
She	1
decided	1
on	1
the	1
latter	1
course.	1
A	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
had	1
passed	1
in	1
freezing	1
vigil	1
on	1
the	1
landing,	1
before	1
it	1
occurred	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
Bosinney	1
had	1
been	1
used	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
key	1
of	1
his	1
rooms	1
under	1
the	1
door-mat.	1
She	1
looked	1
and	1
found	1
it	1
there.	1
For	1
some	1
minutes	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
decide	1
to	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
it;	1
at	1
last	1
she	1
let	1
herself	1
in	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
door	1
open	1
that	1
anyone	1
who	1
came	1
might	1
see	1
she	1
was	1
there	1
on	1
business.	1
This	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
same	1
June	1
who	1
had	1
paid	1
the	1
trembling	1
visit	1
five	1
months	1
ago;	1
those	1
months	1
of	1
suffering	1
and	1
restraint	1
had	1
made	1
her	1
less	1
sensitive;	1
she	1
had	1
dwelt	1
on	1
this	1
visit	1
so	1
long,	1
with	1
such	1
minuteness,	1
that	1
its	1
terrors	1
were	1
discounted	1
beforehand.	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
there	1
to	1
fail	1
this	1
time,	1
for	1
if	1
she	1
failed	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
help	1
her.	1
Like	1
some	1
mother	1
beast	1
on	1
the	1
watch	1
over	1
her	1
young,	1
her	1
little	1
quick	1
figure	1
never	1
stood	1
still	1
in	1
that	1
room,	1
but	1
wandered	1
from	1
wall	1
to	1
wall,	1
from	1
window	1
to	1
door,	1
fingering	1
now	1
one	1
thing,	1
now	1
another.	1
There	1
was	1
dust	1
everywhere,	1
the	1
room	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
cleaned	1
for	1
weeks,	1
and	1
June,	1
quick	1
to	1
catch	1
at	1
anything	1
that	1
should	1
buoy	1
up	1
her	1
hope,	1
saw	1
in	1
it	1
a	1
sign	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
obliged,	1
for	1
economy’s	1
sake,	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
his	1
servant.	1
She	1
looked	1
into	1
the	1
bedroom;	1
the	1
bed	1
was	1
roughly	1
made,	1
as	1
though	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
man.	1
Listening	1
intently,	1
she	1
darted	1
in,	1
and	1
peered	1
into	1
his	1
cupboards.	1
A	1
few	1
shirts	1
and	1
collars,	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
muddy	1
boots	1
—	1
the	1
room	1
was	1
bare	1
even	1
of	1
garments.	1
She	1
stole	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
sitting-room,	1
and	1
now	1
she	1
noticed	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
little	1
things	1
he	1
had	1
set	1
store	1
by.	1
The	1
clock	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
his	1
mother’s,	1
the	1
field-glasses	1
that	1
had	1
hung	1
over	1
the	1
sofa;	1
two	1
really	1
valuable	1
old	1
prints	1
of	1
Harrow,	1
where	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
school,	1
and	1
last,	1
not	1
least,	1
the	1
piece	1
of	1
Japanese	1
pottery	1
she	1
herself	1
had	1
given	1
him.	1
All	1
were	1
gone;	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
rage	1
roused	1
within	1
her	1
championing	1
soul	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
the	1
world	1
should	1
treat	1
him	1
thus,	1
their	1
disappearance	1
augured	1
happily	1
for	1
the	1
success	1
of	1
her	1
plan.	1
It	1
was	1
while	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
the	1
piece	1
of	1
Japanese	1
pottery	1
had	1
stood	1
that	1
she	1
felt	1
a	1
strange	1
certainty	1
of	1
being	1
watched,	1
and,	1
turning,	1
saw	1
Irene	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
doorway.	1
The	1
two	1
stood	1
gazing	1
at	1
each	1
other	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
in	1
silence;	1
then	1
June	1
walked	1
forward	1
and	1
held	1
out	1
her	1
hand.	1
Irene	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
it.	1
When	1
her	1
hand	1
was	1
refused,	1
June	1
put	1
it	1
behind	1
her.	1
Her	1
eyes	1
grew	1
steady	1
with	1
anger;	1
she	1
waited	1
for	1
Irene	1
to	1
speak;	1
and	1
thus	1
waiting,	1
took	1
in,	1
with	1
who-knows-what	1
rage	1
of	1
jealousy,	1
suspicion,	1
and	1
curiosity,	1
every	1
detail	1
of	1
her	1
friend’s	1
face	1
and	1
dress	1
and	1
figure.	1
Irene	1
was	1
clothed	1
in	1
her	1
long	1
grey	1
fur;	1
the	1
travelling	1
cap	1
on	1
her	1
head	1
left	1
a	1
wave	1
of	1
gold	1
hair	1
visible	1
above	1
her	1
forehead.	1
The	1
soft	1
fullness	1
of	1
the	1
coat	1
made	1
her	1
face	1
as	1
small	1
as	1
a	1
child’s.	1
Unlike	1
June’s	1
cheeks,	1
her	1
cheeks	1
had	1
no	1
colour	1
in	1
them,	1
but	1
were	1
ivory	1
white	1
and	1
pinched	1
as	1
if	1
with	1
cold.	1
Dark	1
circles	1
lay	1
round	1
her	1
eyes.	1
In	1
one	1
hand	1
she	1
held	1
a	1
bunch	1
of	1
violets.	1
She	1
looked	1
back	1
at	1
June,	1
no	1
smile	1
on	1
her	1
lips;	1
and	1
with	1
those	1
great	1
dark	1
eyes	1
fastened	1
on	1
her,	1
the	1
girl,	1
for	1
all	1
her	1
startled	1
anger,	1
felt	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
spell.	1
She	1
spoke	1
first,	1
after	1
all.	1
“What	1
have	1
you	1
come	1
for?”	1
But	1
the	1
feeling	1
that	1
she	1
herself	1
was	1
being	1
asked	1
the	1
same	1
question,	1
made	1
her	1
add:	1
“This	1
horrible	1
case.	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
—	1
he	1
has	1
lost	1
it.”	1
Irene	1
did	1
not	1
speak,	1
her	1
eyes	1
never	1
moved	1
from	1
June’s	1
face,	1
and	1
the	1
girl	1
cried:	1
“Don’t	1
stand	1
there	1
as	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
made	1
of	1
stone!”	1
Irene	1
laughed:	1
“I	1
wish	1
to	1
God	1
I	1
were!”	1
But	1
June	1
turned	1
away:	1
“Stop!”	1
she	1
cried,	1
“don’t	1
tell	1
me!	1
I	1
don’t	1
want	1
to	1
hear!	1
I	1
don’t	1
want	1
to	1
hear	1
what	1
you’ve	1
come	1
for.	1
I	1
don’t	1
want	1
to	1
hear!”	1
And	1
like	1
some	1
uneasy	1
spirit,	1
she	1
began	1
swiftly	1
walking	1
to	1
and	1
fro.	1
Suddenly	1
she	1
broke	1
out:	1
“I	1
was	1
here	1
first.	1
We	1
can’t	1
both	1
stay	1
here	1
together!”	1
On	1
Irene’s	1
face	1
a	1
smile	1
wandered	1
up,	1
and	1
died	1
out	1
like	1
a	1
flicker	1
of	1
firelight.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
move.	1
And	1
then	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
June	1
perceived	1
under	1
the	1
softness	1
and	1
immobility	1
of	1
this	1
figure	1
something	1
desperate	1
and	1
resolved;	1
something	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
turned	1
away,	1
something	1
dangerous.	1
She	1
tore	1
off	1
her	1
hat,	1
and,	1
putting	1
both	1
hands	1
to	1
her	1
brow,	1
pressed	1
back	1
the	1
bronze	1
mass	1
of	1
her	1
hair.	1
“You	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
here!”	1
she	1
cried	1
defiantly.	1
Irene	1
answered:	1
“I	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
anywhere!	1
“What	1
do	1
you	1
mean?”	1
“I	1
have	1
left	1
Soames.	1
You	1
always	1
wanted	1
me	1
to!”	1
June	1
put	1
her	1
hands	1
over	1
her	1
ears.	1
“Don’t!	1
I	1
don’t	1
want	1
to	1
hear	1
anything	1
—	1
I	1
don’t	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
anything.	1
It’s	1
impossible	1
to	1
fight	1
with	1
you!	1
What	1
makes	1
you	1
stand	1
like	1
that?	1
Why	1
don’t	1
you	1
go?”	1
Irene’s	1
lips	1
moved;	1
she	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
saying:	1
“Where	1
should	1
I	1
go?”	1
June	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
window.	1
She	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
clock	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
street.	1
It	1
was	1
nearly	1
four.	1
At	1
any	1
moment	1
he	1
might	1
come!	1
She	1
looked	1
back	1
across	1
her	1
shoulder,	1
and	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
distorted	1
with	1
anger.	1
But	1
Irene	1
had	1
not	1
moved;	1
in	1
her	1
gloved	1
hands	1
she	1
ceaselessly	1
turned	1
and	1
twisted	1
the	1
little	1
bunch	1
of	1
violets.	1
The	1
tears	1
of	1
rage	1
and	1
disappointment	1
rolled	1
down	1
June’s	1
cheeks.	1
“How	1
could	1
you	1
come?”	1
she	1
said.	1
“You	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
false	1
friend	1
to	1
me!”	1
Again	1
Irene	1
laughed.	1
June	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
played	1
a	1
wrong	1
card,	1
and	1
broke	1
down.	1
“Why	1
have	1
you	1
come?”	1
she	1
sobbed.	1
“You’ve	1
ruined	1
my	1
life,	1
and	1
now	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
ruin	1
his!”	1
Irene’s	1
mouth	1
quivered;	1
her	1
eyes	1
met	1
June’s	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
so	1
mournful	1
that	1
the	1
girl	1
cried	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
her	1
sobbing,	1
“No,	1
no!”	1
But	1
Irene’s	1
head	1
bent	1
till	1
it	1
touched	1
her	1
breast.	1
She	1
turned,	1
and	1
went	1
quickly	1
out,	1
hiding	1
her	1
lips	1
with	1
the	1
little	1
bunch	1
of	1
violets.	1
June	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
door.	1
She	1
heard	1
the	1
footsteps	1
going	1
down	1
and	1
down.	1
She	1
called	1
out:	1
“Come	1
back,	1
Irene!	1
Come	1
back!”	1
The	1
footsteps	1
died	1
away.	1
.	3
Bewildered	1
and	1
torn,	1
the	1
girl	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
stairs.	1
Why	1
had	1
Irene	1
gone,	1
leaving	1
her	1
mistress	1
of	1
the	1
field?	1
What	1
did	1
it	1
mean?	1
Had	1
she	1
really	1
given	1
him	1
up	1
to	1
her?	1
Or	1
had	1
she	1
.	2
.?	1
And	1
she	1
was	1
the	1
prey	1
of	1
a	1
gnawing	1
uncertainty.	1
.	3
Bosinney	1
did	1
not	1
come.	1
.	3
About	1
six	1
o’clock	1
that	1
afternoon	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
returned	1
from	1
Wistaria	1
Avenue,	1
where	1
now	1
almost	1
every	1
day	1
he	1
spent	1
some	1
hours,	1
and	1
asked	1
if	1
his	1
grand-daughter	1
were	1
upstairs.	1
On	1
being	1
told	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
just	1
come	1
in,	1
he	1
sent	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
room	1
to	1
request	1
her	1
to	1
come	1
down	1
and	1
speak	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
had	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
reconciled	1
with	1
her	1
father.	1
In	1
future	1
bygones	1
must	1
be	1
bygones.	1
He	1
would	1
no	1
longer	1
live	1
alone,	1
or	1
practically	1
alone,	1
in	1
this	1
great	1
house;	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
up,	1
and	1
take	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
for	1
his	1
son,	1
where	1
they	1
could	1
all	1
go	1
and	1
live	1
together.	1
If	1
June	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
this,	1
she	1
could	1
have	1
an	1
allowance	1
and	1
live	1
by	1
herself.	1
It	1
wouldn’t	1
make	1
much	1
difference	1
to	1
her,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
since	1
she	1
had	1
shown	1
him	1
any	1
affection.	1
But	1
when	1
June	1
came	1
down,	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
pinched	1
and	1
piteous;	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
strained,	1
pathetic	1
look	1
in	1
her	1
eyes.	1
She	1
snuggled	1
up	1
in	1
her	1
old	1
attitude	1
on	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
his	1
chair,	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
compared	1
but	1
poorly	1
with	1
the	1
clear,	1
authoritative,	1
injured	1
statement	1
he	1
had	1
thought	1
out	1
with	1
much	1
care.	1
His	1
heart	1
felt	1
sore,	1
as	1
the	1
great	1
heart	1
of	1
a	1
mother-bird	1
feels	1
sore	1
when	1
its	1
youngling	1
flies	1
and	1
bruises	1
its	1
wing.	1
His	1
words	1
halted,	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
apologizing	1
for	1
having	1
at	1
last	1
deviated	1
from	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
virtue,	1
and	1
succumbed,	1
in	1
defiance	1
of	1
sounder	1
principles,	1
to	1
his	1
more	1
natural	1
instincts.	1
He	1
seemed	1
nervous	1
lest,	1
in	1
thus	1
announcing	1
his	1
intentions,	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
setting	1
his	1
granddaughter	1
a	1
bad	1
example;	1
and	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
point,	1
his	1
way	1
of	1
putting	1
the	1
suggestion	1
that,	1
if	1
she	1
didn’t	1
like	1
it,	1
she	1
could	1
live	1
by	1
herself	1
and	1
lump	1
it,	1
was	1
delicate	1
in	1
the	1
extreme.’	1
“And	1
if,	1
by	1
any	1
chance,	1
my	1
darling,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“you	1
found	1
you	1
didn’t	1
get	1
on	1
—	1
with	1
them,	1
why,	1
I	1
could	1
make	1
that	1
all	1
right.	1
You	1
could	1
have	1
what	1
you	1
liked.	1
We	1
could	1
find	1
a	1
little	1
flat	1
in	1
London	1
where	1
you	1
could	1
set	1
up,	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
be	1
running	1
to	1
continually.	1
But	1
the	1
children,”	1
he	1
added,	1
“are	1
dear	1
little	1
things!”	1
Then,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
this	1
grave,	1
rather	1
transparent,	1
explanation	1
of	1
changed	1
policy,	1
his	1
eyes	1
twinkled.	1
“This’ll	1
astonish	1
Timothy’s	1
weak	1
nerves.	1
That	1
precious	1
young	1
thing	1
will	1
have	1
something	1
to	1
say	1
about	1
this,	1
or	1
I’m	1
a	1
Dutchman!”	1
June	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
spoken.	1
Perched	1
thus	1
on	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
his	1
chair,	1
with	1
her	1
head	1
above	1
him,	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
invisible.	1
But	1
presently	1
he	1
felt	1
her	1
warm	1
cheek	1
against	1
his	1
own,	1
and	1
knew	1
that,	1
at	1
all	1
events,	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
very	1
alarming	1
in	1
her	1
attitude	1
towards	1
his	1
news.	1
He	1
began	1
to	1
take	1
courage.	1
“You’ll	1
like	1
your	1
father,”	1
he	1
said	1
—“an	1
amiable	1
chap.	1
Never	1
was	1
much	1
push	1
about	1
him,	1
but	1
easy	1
to	1
get	1
on	1
with.	1
You’ll	1
find	1
him	1
artistic	1
and	1
all	1
that.”	1
And	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
bethought	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
dozen	1
or	1
so	1
water-colour	1
drawings	1
all	1
carefully	1
locked	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
bedroom;	1
for	1
now	1
that	1
his	1
son	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
become	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
property	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
them	1
quite	1
such	1
poor	1
things	1
as	1
heretofore.	1
“As	1
to	1
your	1
—	1
your	1
stepmother,”	1
he	1
said,	1
using	1
the	1
word	1
with	1
some	1
little	1
difficulty,	1
“I	1
call	1
her	1
a	1
refined	1
woman	1
—	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
a	1
Mrs.	1
Gummidge,	1
I	1
shouldn’t	1
wonder	1
—	1
but	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
Jo.	1
And	1
the	1
children,”	1
he	1
repeated	1
—	1
indeed,	1
this	1
sentence	1
ran	1
like	1
music	1
through	1
all	1
his	1
solemn	1
self-justification	1
—“are	1
sweet	1
little	1
things!”	1
If	1
June	1
had	1
known,	1
those	1
words	1
but	1
reincarnated	1
that	1
tender	1
love	1
for	1
little	1
children,	1
for	1
the	1
young	1
and	1
weak,	1
which	1
in	1
the	1
past	1
had	1
made	1
him	1
desert	1
his	1
son	1
for	1
her	1
tiny	1
self,	1
and	1
now,	1
as	1
the	1
cycle	1
rolled,	1
was	1
taking	1
him	1
from	1
her.	1
But	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
get	1
alarmed	1
at	1
her	1
silence,	1
and	1
asked	1
impatiently:	1
“Well,	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
say?”	1
June	1
slid	1
down	1
to	1
his	1
knee,	1
and	1
she	1
in	1
her	1
turn	1
began	1
her	1
tale.	1
She	1
thought	1
it	1
would	1
all	1
go	1
splendidly;	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
any	1
difficulty,	1
and	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
a	1
bit	1
what	1
people	1
thought.	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
wriggled.	1
H’m!	1
then	1
people	1
would	1
think!	1
He	1
had	1
thought	1
that	1
after	1
all	1
these	1
years	1
perhaps	1
they	1
wouldn’t!	1
Well,	1
he	1
couldn’t	1
help	1
it!	1
Nevertheless,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
approve	1
of	1
his	1
granddaughter’s	1
way	1
of	1
putting	1
it	1
—	1
she	1
ought	1
to	1
mind	1
what	1
people	1
thought!	1
Yet	1
he	1
said	1
nothing.	1
His	1
feelings	1
were	1
too	1
mixed,	1
too	1
inconsistent	1
for	1
expression.	1
No	1
—	1
went	1
on	1
June	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
care;	1
what	1
business	1
was	1
it	1
of	1
theirs?	1
There	1
was	1
only	1
one	1
thing	1
—	1
and	1
with	1
her	1
cheek	1
pressing	1
against	1
his	1
knee,	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
knew	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
this	1
something	1
was	1
no	1
trifle:	1
As	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
buy	1
a	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
country,	1
would	1
he	1
not	1
—	1
to	1
please	1
her	1
—	1
buy	1
that	1
splendid	1
house	1
of	1
Soames’	1
at	1
Robin	1
Hill?	1
It	1
was	1
finished,	1
it	1
was	1
perfectly	1
beautiful,	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
would	1
live	1
in	1
it	1
now.	1
They	1
would	1
all	1
be	1
so	1
happy	1
there.	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
alert	1
at	1
once.	1
Wasn’t	1
the	1
‘man	1
of	1
property’	1
going	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
his	1
new	1
house,	1
then?	1
He	1
never	1
alluded	1
to	1
Soames	1
now	1
but	1
under	1
this	1
title.	1
“No”—	1
June	1
said	1
—“he	1
was	1
not;	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not!”	1
How	1
did	1
she	1
know?	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
tell	1
him,	1
but	1
she	1
knew.	1
She	1
knew	1
nearly	1
for	1
certain!	1
It	1
was	1
most	1
unlikely;	1
circumstances	1
had	1
changed!	1
Irene’s	1
words	1
still	1
rang	1
in	1
her	1
head:	1
“I	1
have	1
left	1
Soames.	1
Where	1
should	1
I	1
go?”	1
But	1
she	1
kept	1
silence	1
about	1
that.	1
If	1
her	1
grandfather	1
would	1
only	1
buy	1
it	1
and	1
settle	1
that	1
wretched	1
claim	1
that	1
ought	1
never	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
on	1
Phil!	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
very	1
best	1
thing	1
for	1
everybody,	1
and	1
everything	1
—	1
everything	1
might	1
come	1
straight.	1
And	1
June	1
put	1
her	1
lips	1
to	1
his	1
forehead,	1
and	1
pressed	1
them	1
close.	1
But	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
freed	1
himself	1
from	1
her	1
caress,	1
his	1
face	1
wore	1
the	1
judicial	1
look	1
which	1
came	1
upon	1
it	1
when	1
he	1
dealt	1
with	1
affairs.	1
He	1
asked:	1
What	1
did	1
she	1
mean?	1
There	1
was	1
something	1
behind	1
all	1
this	1
—	1
had	1
she	1
been	1
seeing	1
Bosinney?	1
June	1
answered:	1
“No;	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
to	1
his	1
rooms.”	1
“Been	1
to	1
his	1
rooms?	1
Who	1
took	1
you	1
there?”	1
June	1
faced	1
him	1
steadily.	1
“I	1
went	1
alone.	1
He	1
has	1
lost	1
that	1
case.	1
I	1
don’t	1
care	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
right	1
or	1
wrong.	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
help	1
him;	1
and	1
I	1
will!”	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
asked	1
again:	1
“Have	1
you	1
seen	1
him?”	1
His	1
glance	1
seemed	1
to	1
pierce	1
right	1
through	1
the	1
girl’s	1
eyes	1
into	1
her	1
soul.	1
Again	1
June	1
answered:	1
“No;	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
there.	1
I	1
waited,	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
come.”	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
made	1
a	1
movement	1
of	1
relief.	1
She	1
had	1
risen	1
and	1
looked	1
down	1
at	1
him;	1
so	1
slight,	1
and	1
light,	1
and	1
young,	1
but	1
so	1
fixed,	1
and	1
so	1
determined;	1
and	1
disturbed,	1
vexed,	1
as	1
he	1
was,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
frown	1
away	1
that	1
fixed	1
look.	1
The	1
feeling	1
of	1
being	1
beaten,	1
of	1
the	1
reins	1
having	1
slipped,	1
of	1
being	1
old	1
and	1
tired,	1
mastered	1
him.	1
“Ah!”	1
he	1
said	1
at	1
last,	1
“you’ll	1
get	1
yourself	1
into	1
a	1
mess	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
days,	1
I	1
can	1
see.	1
You	1
want	1
your	1
own	1
way	1
in	1
everything.”	1
Visited	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
strange	1
bursts	1
of	1
philosophy,	1
he	1
added:	1
“Like	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
born;	1
and	1
like	1
that	1
you’ll	1
stay	1
until	1
you	1
die!”	1
And	1
he,	1
who	1
in	1
his	1
dealings	1
with	1
men	1
of	1
business,	1
with	1
Boards,	1
with	1
Forsytes	1
of	1
all	1
descriptions,	1
with	1
such	1
as	1
were	1
not	1
Forsytes,	1
had	1
always	1
had	1
his	1
own	1
way,	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
indomitable	1
grandchild	1
sadly	1
—	1
for	1
he	1
felt	1
in	1
her	1
that	1
quality	1
which	1
above	1
all	1
others	1
he	1
unconsciously	1
admired.	1
“Do	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
they	1
say	1
is	1
going	1
on?”	1
he	1
said	1
slowly.	1
June	1
crimsoned.	1
“Yes	1
—	1
no!	1
I	1
know	1
—	1
and	1
I	1
don’t	1
know	1
—	1
I	1
don’t	1
care!”	1
and	1
she	1
stamped	1
her	1
foot.	1
“I	1
believe,”	1
said	1
old	1
Jolyon,	1
dropping	1
his	1
eyes,	1
“that	1
you’d	1
have	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
dead!”	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
silence	1
before	1
he	1
spoke	1
again.	1
“But	1
as	1
to	1
buying	1
this	1
house	1
—	1
you	1
don’t	1
know	1
what	1
you’re	1
talking	1
about!”	1
June	1
said	1
that	1
she	1
did.	1
She	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
get	1
it	1
if	1
he	1
wanted.	1
He	1
would	1
only	1
have	1
to	1
give	1
what	1
it	1
cost.	1
“What	1
it	1
cost!	1
You	1
know	1
nothing	1
about	1
it.	1
I	1
won’t	1
go	1
to	1
Soames	1
—	1
I’ll	1
have	1
nothing	1
more	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
that	1
young	1
man.”	1
“But	1
you	1
needn’t;	1
you	1
can	1
go	1
to	1
Uncle	1
James.	1
If	1
you	1
can’t	1
buy	1
the	1
house,	1
will	1
you	1
pay	1
his	1
lawsuit	1
claim?	1
I	1
know	1
he	1
is	1
terribly	1
hard	1
up	1
—	1
I’ve	1
seen	1
it.	1
You	1
can	1
stop	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
money!”	1
A	1
twinkle	1
came	1
into	1
old	1
Jolyon’s	1
eyes.	1
“Stop	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
money!	1
A	1
pretty	1
way.	1
And	1
what	1
will	1
you	1
do,	1
pray,	1
without	1
your	1
money?”	1
But	1
secretly,	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
wresting	1
the	1
house	1
from	1
James	1
and	1
his	1
son	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
him.	1
He	1
had	1
heard	1
on	1
Forsyte	1
‘Change	1
much	1
comment,	1
much	1
rather	1
doubtful	1
praise	1
of	1
this	1
house.	1
It	1
was	1
‘too	1
artistic,’	1
but	1
a	1
fine	1
place.	1
To	1
take	1
from	1
the	1
‘man	1
of	1
property’	1
that	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
set	1
his	1
heart,	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
crowning	1
triumph	1
over	1
James,	1
practical	1
proof	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
property	1
of	1
Jo,	1
to	1
put	1
him	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
proper	1
position,	1
and	1
there	1
to	1
keep	1
him	1
secure.	1
Justice	1
once	1
for	1
all	1
on	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
chosen	1
to	1
regard	1
his	1
son	1
as	1
a	1
poor,	1
penniless	1
outcast.	1
He	1
would	1
see,	1
he	1
would	1
see!	1
It	1
might	1
be	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question;	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
pay	1
a	1
fancy	1
price,	1
but	1
if	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
done,	1
why,	1
perhaps	1
he	1
would	1
do	1
it!	1
And	1
still	1
more	1
secretly	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
refuse	1
her.	1
But	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
commit	1
himself.	1
He	1
would	1
think	1
it	1
over	1
—	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
June.	1
Chapter	1
31	1
Bosinney’s	1
Departure	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
was	1
not	1
given	1
to	1
hasty	1
decisions;	1
it	1
is	1
probable	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
continued	1
to	1
think	1
over	1
the	1
purchase	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
at	1
Robin	1
Hill,	1
had	1
not	1
June’s	1
face	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
no	1
peace	1
until	1
he	1
acted.	1
At	1
breakfast	1
next	1
morning	1
she	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
time	1
she	1
should	1
order	1
the	1
carriage.	1
“Carriage!”	1
he	1
said,	1
with	1
some	1
appearance	1
of	1
innocence;	1
“what	1
for?	1
I’m	1
not	1
going	1
out!”	1
She	1
answered:	1
“If	1
you	1
don’t	1
go	1
early,	1
you	1
won’t	1
catch	1
Uncle	1
James	1
before	1
he	1
goes	1
into	1
the	1
City.”	1
“James!	1
what	1
about	1
your	1
Uncle	1
James?”	1
“The	1
house,”	1
she	1
replied,	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
voice	1
that	1
he	1
no	1
longer	1
pretended	1
ignorance.	1
“I’ve	1
not	1
made	1
up	1
my	1
mind,”	1
he	1
said.	1
“You	1
must!	1
You	1
must!	1
Oh!	1
Gran	1
—	1
think	1
of	1
me!”	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
grumbled	1
out:	1
“Think	1
of	1
you	1
—	1
I’m	1
always	1
thinking	1
of	1
you,	1
but	1
you	1
don’t	1
think	1
of	1
yourself;	1
you	1
don’t	1
think	1
what	1
you’re	1
letting	1
yourself	1
in	1
for.	1
Well,	1
order	1
the	1
carriage	1
at	1
ten!”	1
At	1
a	1
quarter	1
past	1
he	1
was	1
placing	1
his	1
umbrella	1
in	1
the	1
stand	1
at	1
Park	1
Lane	1
—	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
choose	1
to	1
relinquish	1
his	1
hat	1
and	1
coat;	1
telling	1
Warmson	1
that	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
master,	1
he	1
went,	1
without	1
being	1
announced,	1
into	1
the	1
study,	1
and	1
sat	1
down.	1
James	1
was	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
dining-room	1
talking	1
to	1
Soames,	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
round	1
again	1
before	1
breakfast.	1
On	1
hearing	1
who	1
his	1
visitor	1
was,	1
he	1
muttered	1
nervously:	1
“Now,	1
what’s	1
he	1
want,	1
I	1
wonder?”	1
He	1
then	1
got	1
up.	1
“Well,”	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Soames,	1
“don’t	1
you	1
go	1
doing	1
anything	1
in	1
a	1
hurry.	1
The	1
first	1
thing	1
is	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
where	1
she	1
is	1
—	1
I	1
should	1
go	1
to	1
Stainer’s	1
about	1
it;	1
they’re	1
the	1
best	1
men,	1
if	1
they	1
can’t	1
find	1
her,	1
nobody	1
can.”	1
And	1
suddenly	1
moved	1
to	1
strange	1
softness,	1
he	1
muttered	1
to	1
himself,	1
“Poor	1
little	1
thing,	1
I	1
can’t	1
tell	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
thinking	1
about!”	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
blowing	1
his	1
nose.	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
did	1
not	1
rise	1
on	1
seeing	1
his	1
brother,	1
but	1
held	1
out	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
exchanged	1
with	1
him	1
the	1
clasp	1
of	1
a	1
Forsyte.	1
James	1
took	1
another	1
chair	1
by	1
the	1
table,	1
and	1
leaned	1
his	1
head	1
on	1
his	1
hand.	1
“Well,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“how	1
are	1
you?	1
We	1
don’t	1
see	1
much	1
of	1
you	1
nowadays!”	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
paid	1
no	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
remark.	1
“How’s	1
Emily?”	1
he	1
asked;	1
and	1
waiting	1
for	1
no	1
reply,	1
went	1
on	1
“I’ve	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
about	1
this	1
affair	1
of	1
young	1
Bosinney’s.	1
I’m	1
told	1
that	1
new	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
is	1
a	1
white	1
elephant.”	1
“I	1
don’t	1
know	1
anything	1
about	1
a	1
white	1
elephant,”	1
said	1
James,	1
“I	1
know	1
he’s	1
lost	1
his	1
case,	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
say	1
he’ll	1
go	1
bankrupt.”	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
was	1
not	1
slow	1
to	1
seize	1
the	1
opportunity	1
this	1
gave	1
him.	1
“I	1
shouldn’t	1
wonder	1
a	1
bit!”	1
he	1
agreed;	1
“and	1
if	1
he	1
goes	1
bankrupt,	1
the	1
‘man	1
of	1
property’—	1
that	1
is,	1
Soames’ll	1
be	1
out	1
of	1
pocket.	1
Now,	1
what	1
I	1
was	1
thinking	1
was	1
this:	1
If	1
he’s	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
live	1
there.	1
.	3
”	1
Seeing	1
both	1
surprise	1
and	1
suspicion	1
in	1
James’	1
eye,	1
he	1
quickly	1
went	1
on:	1
“I	1
don’t	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
anything;	1
I	1
suppose	1
Irene’s	1
put	1
her	1
foot	1
down	1
—	1
it’s	1
not	1
material	1
to	1
me.	1
But	1
I’m	1
thinking	1
of	1
a	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
myself,	1
not	1
too	1
far	1
from	1
London,	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
suited	1
me	1
I	1
don’t	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
mightn’t	1
look	1
at	1
it,	1
at	1
a	1
price.”	1
James	1
listened	1
to	1
this	1
statement	1
with	1
a	1
strange	1
mixture	1
of	1
doubt,	1
suspicion,	1
and	1
relief,	1
merging	1
into	1
a	1
dread	1
of	1
something	1
behind,	1
and	1
tinged	1
with	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
his	1
old	1
undoubted	1
reliance	1
upon	1
his	1
elder	1
brother’s	1
good	1
faith	1
and	1
judgment.	1
There	1
was	1
anxiety,	1
too,	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
could	1
have	1
heard	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
it;	1
and	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
hopefulness	1
arising	1
from	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
if	1
June’s	1
connection	1
with	1
Bosinney	1
were	1
completely	1
at	1
an	1
end,	1
her	1
grandfather	1
would	1
hardly	1
seem	1
anxious	1
to	1
help	1
the	1
young	1
fellow.	1
Altogether	1
he	1
was	1
puzzled;	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
either	1
to	1
show	1
this,	1
or	1
to	1
commit	1
himself	1
in	1
any	1
way,	1
he	1
said:	1
“They	1
tell	1
me	1
you’re	1
altering	1
your	1
Will	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
your	1
son.”	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
told	1
this;	1
he	1
had	1
merely	1
added	1
the	1
fact	1
of	1
having	1
seen	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
with	1
his	1
son	1
and	1
grandchildren	1
to	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
his	1
Will	1
away	1
from	1
Forsyte,	1
Bustard	1
and	1
Forsyte.	1
The	1
shot	1
went	1
home.	1
“Who	1
told	1
you	1
that?”	1
asked	1
old	1
Jolyon.	1
“I’m	1
sure	1
I	1
don’t	1
know,”	1
said	1
James;	1
“I	1
can’t	1
remember	1
names	1
—	1
I	1
know	1
somebody	1
told	1
me	1
Soames	1
spent	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
money	1
on	1
this	1
house;	1
he’s	1
not	1
likely	1
to	1
part	1
with	1
it	1
except	1
at	1
a	1
good	1
price.”	1
“Well,”	1
said	1
old	1
Jolyon,	1
“if,	1
he	1
thinks	1
I’m	1
going	1
to	1
pay	1
a	1
fancy	1
price,	1
he’s	1
mistaken.	1
I’ve	1
not	1
got	1
the	1
money	1
to	1
throw	1
away	1
that	1
he	1
seems	1
to	1
have.	1
Let	1
him	1
try	1
and	1
sell	1
it	1
at	1
a	1
forced	1
sale,	1
and	1
see	1
what	1
he’ll	1
get.	1
It’s	1
not	1
every	1
man’s	1
house,	1
I	1
hear!”	1
James,	1
who	1
was	1
secretly	1
also	1
of	1
this	1
opinion,	1
answered:	1
“It’s	1
a	1
gentleman’s	1
house.	1
Soames	1
is	1
here	1
now	1
if	1
you’d	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
him.”	1
“No,”	1
said	1
old	1
Jolyon,	1
“I	1
haven’t	1
got	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
that;	1
and	1
I’m	1
not	1
likely	1
to,	1
I	1
can	1
see	1
that	1
very	1
well	1
if	1
I’m	1
met	1
in	1
this	1
manner!”	1
James	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
cowed;	1
when	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
actual	1
figures	1
of	1
a	1
commercial	1
transaction	1
he	1
was	1
sure	1
of	1
himself,	1
for	1
then	1
he	1
was	1
dealing	1
with	1
facts,	1
not	1
with	1
men;	1
but	1
preliminary	1
negotiations	1
such	1
as	1
these	1
made	1
him	1
nervous	1
—	1
he	1
never	1
knew	1
quite	1
how	1
far	1
he	1
could	1
go.	1
“Well,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“I	1
know	1
nothing	1
about	1
it.	1
Soames,	1
he	1
tells	1
me	1
nothing;	1
I	1
should	1
think	1
he’d	1
entertain	1
it	1
—	1
it’s	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
price.”	1
“Oh!”	1
said	1
old	1
Jolyon,	1
“don’t	1
let	1
him	1
make	1
a	1
favour	1
of	1
it!”	1
He	1
placed	1
his	1
hat	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
dudgeon.	1
The	1
door	1
was	1
opened	1
and	1
Soames	1
came	1
in.	1
“There’s	1
a	1
policeman	1
out	1
here,”	1
he	1
said	1
with	1
his	1
half	1
smile,	1
“for	1
Uncle	1
Jolyon.”	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
angrily,	1
and	1
James	1
said:	1
“A	1
policeman?	1
I	1
don’t	1
know	1
anything	1
about	1
a	1
policeman.	1
But	1
I	1
suppose	1
you	1
know	1
something	1
about	1
him,”	1
he	1
added	1
to	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
suspicion:	1
“I	1
suppose	1
you’d	1
better	1
see	1
him!”	1
In	1
the	1
hall	1
an	1
Inspector	1
of	1
Police	1
stood	1
stolidly	1
regarding	1
with	1
heavy-lidded	1
pale-blue	1
eyes	1
the	1
fine	1
old	1
English	1
furniture	1
picked	1
up	1
by	1
James	1
at	1
the	1
famous	1
Mavrojano	1
sale	1
in	1
Portman	1
Square.	1
“You’ll	1
find	1
my	1
brother	1
in	1
there,”	1
said	1
James.	1
The	1
Inspector	1
raised	1
his	1
fingers	1
respectfully	1
to	1
his	1
peaked	1
cap,	1
and	1
entered	1
the	1
study.	1
James	1
saw	1
him	1
go	1
in	1
with	1
a	1
strange	1
sensation.	1
“Well,”	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Soames,	1
“I	1
suppose	1
we	1
must	1
wait	1
and	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
wants.	1
Your	1
uncle’s	1
been	1
here	1
about	1
the	1
house!”	1
He	1
returned	1
with	1
Soames	1
into	1
the	1
dining-room,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
rest.	1
“Now	1
what	1
does	1
he	1
want?”	1
he	1
murmured	1
again.	1
“Who?”	1
replied	1
Soames:	1
“the	1
Inspector?	1
They	1
sent	1
him	1
round	1
from	1
Stanhope	1
Gate,	1
that’s	1
all	1
I	1
know.	1
That	1
‘nonconformist’	1
of	1
Uncle	1
Jolyon’s	1
has	1
been	1
pilfering,	1
I	1
shouldn’t	1
wonder!”	1
But	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
calmness,	1
he	1
too	1
was	1
ill	1
at	1
ease.	1
At	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
ten	1
minutes	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
came	1
in.	1
He	1
walked	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
table,	1
and	1
stood	1
there	1
perfectly	1
silent	1
pulling	1
at	1
his	1
long	1
white	1
moustaches.	1
James	1
gazed	1
up	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
opening	1
mouth;	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
his	1
brother	1
look	1
like	1
this.	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
raised	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
said	1
slowly:	1
“Young	1
Bosinney	1
has	1
been	1
run	1
over	1
in	1
the	1
fog	1
and	1
killed.”	1
Then	1
standing	1
above	1
his	1
brother	1
and	1
his	1
nephew,	1
and	1
looking	1
down	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
deep	1
eyes:	1
“There’s	1
—	1
some	1
—	1
talk	1
—	1
of	1
—	1
suicide,”	1
he	1
said.	1
James’	1
jaw	1
dropped.	1
“Suicide!	1
What	1
should	1
he	1
do	1
that	1
for?”	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
answered	1
sternly:	1
“God	1
knows,	1
if	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
son	1
don’t!”	1
But	1
James	1
did	1
not	1
reply.	1
For	1
all	1
men	1
of	1
great	1
age,	1
even	1
for	1
all	1
Forsytes,	1
life	1
has	1
had	1
bitter	1
experiences.	1
The	1
passer-by,	1
who	1
sees	1
them	1
wrapped	1
in	1
cloaks	1
of	1
custom,	1
wealth,	1
and	1
comfort,	1
would	1
never	1
suspect	1
that	1
such	1
black	1
shadows	1
had	1
fallen	1
on	1
their	1
roads.	1
To	1
every	1
man	1
of	1
great	1
age	1
—	1
to	1
Sir	1
Walter	1
Bentham	1
himself	1
—	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
suicide	1
has	1
once	1
at	1
least	1
been	1
present	1
in	1
the	1
ante-room	1
of	1
his	1
soul;	1
on	1
the	1
threshold,	1
waiting	1
to	1
enter,	1
held	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
inmost	1
chamber	1
by	1
some	1
chance	1
reality,	1
some	1
vague	1
fear,	1
some	1
painful	1
hope.	1
To	1
Forsytes	1
that	1
final	1
renunciation	1
of	1
property	1
is	1
hard.	1
Oh!	1
it	1
is	1
hard!	1
Seldom	1
—	1
perhaps	1
never	1
—	1
can	1
they	1
achieve,	1
it;	1
and	1
yet,	1
how	1
near	1
have	1
they	1
not	1
sometimes	1
been!	1
So	1
even	1
with	1
James!	1
Then	1
in	1
the	1
medley	1
of	1
his	1
thoughts,	1
he	1
broke	1
out:	1
“Why	1
I	1
saw	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
paper	1
yesterday:	1
‘Run	1
over	1
in	1
the	1
fog!’	1
They	1
didn’t	1
know	1
his	1
name!”	1
He	1
turned	1
from	1
one	1
face	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
in	1
his	1
confusion	1
of	1
soul;	1
but	1
instinctively	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
was	1
rejecting	1
that	1
rumour	1
of	1
suicide.	1
He	1
dared	1
not	1
entertain	1
this	1
thought,	1
so	1
against	1
his	1
interest,	1
against	1
the	1
interest	1
of	1
his	1
son,	1
of	1
every	1
Forsyte.	1
He	1
strove	1
against	1
it;	1
and	1
as	1
his	1
nature	1
ever	1
unconsciously	1
rejected	1
that	1
which	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
with	1
safety	1
accept,	1
so	1
gradually	1
he	1
overcame	1
this	1
fear.	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
accident!	1
It	1
must	1
have	1
been!	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
broke	1
in	1
on	1
his	1
reverie.	1
“Death	1
was	1
instantaneous.	1
He	1
lay	1
all	1
day	1
yesterday	1
at	1
the	1
hospital.	1
There	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
tell	1
them	1
who	1
he	1
was.	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
there	1
now;	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
son	1
had	1
better	1
come	1
too.”	1
No	1
one	1
opposing	1
this	1
command	1
he	1
led	1
the	1
way	1
from	1
the	1
room.	1
The	1
day	1
was	1
still	1
and	1
clear	1
and	1
bright,	1
and	1
driving	1
over	1
to	1
Park	1
Lane	1
from	1
Stanhope	1
Gate,	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
had	2
the	1
carriage	1
open.	1
Sitting	1
back	1
on	1
the	1
padded	1
cushions,	1
finishing	1
his	1
cigar,	1
he	1
had	1
noticed	1
with	1
pleasure	1
the	1
keen	1
crispness	1
of	1
the	1
air,	1
the	1
bustle	1
of	1
the	1
cabs	1
and	1
people;	1
the	1
strange,	1
almost	1
Parisian,	1
alacrity	1
that	1
the	1
first	1
fine	1
day	1
will	1
bring	1
into	1
London	1
streets	1
after	1
a	1
spell	1
of	1
fog	1
or	1
rain.	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
so	1
happy;	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
felt	1
like	1
it	1
for	1
months.	1
His	1
confession	1
to	1
June	1
was	1
off	1
his	1
mind;	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
his	1
son’s,	1
above	1
all,	1
of	1
his	1
grandchildren’s	1
company	1
in	1
the	1
future	1
—(he	1
had	1
appointed	1
to	1
meet	1
young	1
Jolyon	1
at	1
the	1
Hotch	1
Potch	1
that	1
very	1
manning	1
to	1
—	1
discuss	1
it	1
again);	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
pleasurable	1
excitement	1
of	1
a	1
coming	1
encounter,	1
a	1
coming	1
victory,	1
over	1
James	1
and	1
the	1
‘man	1
of	1
property’	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1
of	1
the	1
house.	1
He	1
had	1
the	1
carriage	1
closed	1
now;	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
heart	1
to	1
look	1
on	1
gaiety;	1
nor	1
was	1
it	1
right	1
that	1
Forsytes	1
should	1
be	1
seen	1
driving	1
with	1
an	1
Inspector	1
of	1
Police.	1
In	1
that	1
carriage	1
the	1
Inspector	1
spoke	1
again	1
of	1
the	1
death:	1
“It	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
very	1
thick	1
—	1
Just	1
there.	1
The	1
driver	1
says	1
the	1
gentleman	1
must	1
have	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
about,	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
walk	1
right	1
into	1
it.	1
It	1
appears	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
hard	1
up,	1
we	1
found	1
several	1
pawn	1
tickets	1
at	1
his	1
rooms,	1
his	1
account	1
at	1
the	1
bank	1
is	1
overdrawn,	1
and	1
there’s	1
this	1
case	1
in	1
to-day’s	1
papers;”	1
his	1
cold	1
blue	1
eyes	1
travelled	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
another	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
Forsytes	1
in	1
the	1
carriage.	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
watching	1
from	1
his	1
corner	1
saw	1
his	1
brother’s	1
face	1
change,	1
and	1
the	1
brooding,	1
worried,	1
look	1
deepen	1
on	1
it.	1
At	1
the	1
Inspector’s	1
words,	1
indeed,	1
all	1
James’	1
doubts	1
and	1
fears	1
revived.	1
Hard-up	1
—	1
pawn-tickets	1
—	1
an	1
overdrawn	1
account!	1
These	1
words	1
that	1
had	1
all	1
his	1
life	1
been	1
a	1
far-off	1
nightmare	1
to	1
him,	1
seemed	1
to	1
make	1
uncannily	1
real	1
that	1
suspicion	1
of	1
suicide	1
which	1
must	1
on	1
no	1
account	1
be	1
entertained.	1
He	1
sought	1
his	1
son’s	1
eye;	1
but	1
lynx-eyed,	1
taciturn,	1
immovable,	1
Soames	1
gave	1
no	1
answering	1
look.	1
And	1
to	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
watching,	1
divining	1
the	1
league	1
of	1
mutual	1
defence	1
between	1
them,	1
there	1
came	1
an	1
overmastering	1
desire	1
to	1
have	1
his	1
own	1
son	1
at	1
his	1
side,	1
as	1
though	1
this	1
visit	1
to	1
the	1
dead	1
man’s	1
body	1
was	1
a	1
battle	1
in	1
which	1
otherwise	1
he	1
must	1
single-handed	1
meet	1
those	1
two.	1
And	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
how	1
to	1
keep	1
June’s	1
name	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
business	1
kept	1
whirring	1
in	1
his	1
brain.	1
James	1
had	1
his	1
son	1
to	1
support	1
him!	1
Why	1
should	1
he	1
not	1
send	1
for	1
Jo?	1
Taking	1
out	1
his	1
card-case,	1
he	1
pencilled	1
the	1
following	1
message:	1
‘Come	1
round	1
at	1
once.	1
I’ve	1
sent	1
the	1
carriage	1
for	1
you.’	1
On	1
getting	1
out	1
he	1
gave	1
this	1
card	1
to	1
his	1
coachman,	1
telling	1
him	1
to	1
drive	1
—	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
possible	1
to	1
the	1
Hotch	1
Potch	1
Club,	1
and	1
if	1
Mr.	1
Jolyon	1
Forsyte	1
were	1
there	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
the	1
card	1
and	1
bring	1
him	1
at	1
once.	1
If	1
not	1
there	1
yet,	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
wait	1
till	1
he	1
came.	1
He	1
followed	1
the	1
others	1
slowly	1
up	1
the	1
steps,	1
leaning	1
on	1
his	1
umbrella,	1
and	1
stood	1
a	1
moment	1
to	1
get	1
his	1
breath.	1
The	1
Inspector	1
said:	1
“This	1
is	1
the	1
mortuary,	1
sir.	1
But	1
take	1
your	1
time.”	1
In	1
the	1
bare,	1
white-walled	1
room,	1
empty	1
of	1
all	1
but	1
a	1
streak	1
of	1
sunshine	1
smeared	1
along	1
the	1
dustless	1
floor,	1
lay	1
a	1
form	1
covered	1
by	1
a	1
sheet.	1
With	1
a	1
huge	1
steady	1
hand	1
the	1
Inspector	1
took	1
the	1
hem	1
and	1
turned	1
it	1
back.	1
A	1
sightless	1
face	1
gazed	1
up	1
at	1
them,	1
and	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
of	1
that	1
sightless	1
defiant	1
face	1
the	1
three	1
Forsytes	1
gazed	1
down;	1
in	1
each	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
the	1
secret	1
emotions,	1
fears,	1
and	1
pity	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
nature	1
rose	1
and	1
fell	1
like	1
the	1
rising,	1
falling	1
waves	1
of	1
life,	1
whose	1
wish	1
those	1
white	1
walls	1
barred	1
out	1
now	1
for	1
ever	1
from	1
Bosinney.	1
And	1
in	1
each	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
the	1
trend	1
of	1
his	1
nature,	1
the	1
odd	1
essential	1
spring,	1
which	1
moved	1
him	1
in	1
fashions	1
minutely,	1
unalterably	1
different	1
from	1
those	1
of	1
every	1
other	1
human	1
being,	1
forced	1
him	1
to	1
a	1
different	1
attitude	1
of	1
thought.	1
Far	1
from	1
the	1
others,	1
yet	1
inscrutably	1
close,	1
each	1
stood	1
thus,	1
alone	1
with	1
death,	1
silent,	1
his	1
eyes	1
lowered.	1
The	1
Inspector	1
asked	1
softly:	1
“You	1
identify	1
the	1
gentleman,	1
sir?”	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
raised	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
nodded.	1
He	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
brother	1
opposite,	1
at	1
that	1
long	1
lean	1
figure	1
brooding	1
over	1
the	1
dead	1
man,	1
with	1
face	1
dusky	1
red,	1
and	1
strained	1
grey	1
eyes;	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
figure	1
of	1
Soames	1
white	1
and	1
still	1
by	1
his	1
father’s	1
side.	1
And	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
against	1
those	1
two	1
was	1
gone	1
like	1
smoke	1
in	1
the	1
long	1
white	1
presence	1
of	1
Death.	1
Whence	1
comes	1
it,	1
how	1
comes	1
it	1
—	1
Death?	1
Sudden	1
reverse	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
goes	1
before;	1
blind	1
setting	1
forth	1
on	1
a	1
path	1
that	1
leads	1
to	1
where?	1
Dark	1
quenching	1
of	1
the	1
fire!	1
The	1
heavy,	1
brutal	1
crushing	1
—	1
out	1
that	1
all	1
men	1
must	1
go	1
through,	1
keeping	1
their	1
eyes	1
clear	1
and	1
brave	1
unto	1
the	1
end!	1
Small	1
and	1
of	1
no	1
import,	1
insects	1
though	1
they	1
are!	1
And	1
across	1
old	1
Jolyon’s	1
face	1
there	1
flitted	1
a	1
gleam,	1
for	1
Soames,	1
murmuring	1
to	1
the	1
Inspector,	1
crept	1
noiselessly	1
away.	1
Then	1
suddenly	1
James	1
raised	1
his	1
eyes.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
queer	1
appeal	1
in	1
that	1
suspicious	1
troubled	1
look:	1
“I	1
know	1
I’m	1
no	1
match	1
for	1
you,”	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
say.	1
And,	1
hunting	1
for	1
handkerchief	1
he	1
wiped	1
his	1
brow;	1
then,	1
bending	1
sorrowful	1
and	1
lank	1
over	1
the	1
dead	1
man,	1
he	1
too	1
turned	1
and	1
hurried	1
out.	1
Old	1
Jolyon	1
stood,	1
still	1
as	1
death,	1
his	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
body.	1
Who	1
shall	1
tell	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
thinking?	1
Of	1
himself,	1
when	1
his	1
hair	1
was	1
brown	1
like	1
the	1
hair	1
of	1
that	1
young	1
fellow	1
dead	1
before	1
him?	1
Of	1
himself,	1
with	1
his	1
battle	1
just	1
beginning,	1
the	1
long,	1
long	1
battle	1
he	1
had	1
loved;	1
the	1
battle	1
that	1
was	1
over	1
for	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
almost	1
before	1
it	1
had	1
begun?	1
Of	1
his	1
grand-daughter,	1
with	1
her	1
broken	1
hopes?	1
Of	1
that	1
other	1
woman?	1
Of	1
the	1
strangeness,	1
and	1
the	1
pity	1
of	1
it?	1
And	1
the	1
irony,	1
inscrutable,	1
and	1
bitter	1
of	1
that	1
end?	1
Justice!	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
justice	1
for	1
men,	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
ever	1
in	1
the	1
dark!	1
Or	1
perhaps	1
in	1
his	1
philosophy	1
he	1
thought:	1
Better	1
to	1
be	1
out	1
of,	1
it	1
all!	1
Better	1
to	1
have	1
done	1
with	1
it,	1
like	1
this	1
poor	1
youth.	1
.	3
Some	1
one	1
touched	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
arm.	1
A	1
tear	1
started	1
up	1
and	1
wetted	1
his	1
eyelash.	1
“Well,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“I’m	1
no	1
good	1
here.	1
I’d	1
better	1
be	1
going.	1
You’ll	1
come	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
you	1
can,	1
Jo,”	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
bowed	1
he	1
went	1
away.	1
It	1
was	1
young	1
Jolyon’s	1
turn	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
stand	1
beside	1
the	1
dead	1
man,	1
round	1
whose	1
fallen	1
body	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
see	1
all	1
the	1
Forsytes	1
breathless,	1
and	1
prostrated.	1
The	1
stroke	1
had	1
fallen	1
too	1
swiftly.	1
The	1
forces	1
underlying	1
every	1
tragedy	1
—	1
forces	1
that	1
take	1
no	1
denial,	1
working	1
through	1
cross	1
currents	1
to	1
their	1
ironical	1
end,	1
had	1
met	1
and	1
fused	1
with	1
a	1
thunder-clap,	1
flung	1
out	1
the	1
victim,	1
and	1
flattened	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
all	1
those	1
that	1
stood	1
around.	1
Or	1
so	1
at	1
all	1
events	1
young	1
Jolyon	1
seemed	1
to	1
see	1
them,	1
lying	1
around	1
Bosinney’s	1
body.	1
He	1
asked	1
the	1
Inspector	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
what	1
had	1
happened,	1
and	1
the	1
latter,	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
does	1
not	1
every	1
day	1
get	1
such	1
a	1
chance,	1
again	1
detailed	1
such	1
facts	1
as	1
were	1
known.	1
“There’s	1
more	1
here,	1
sir,	1
however,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“than	1
meets	1
the	1
eye.	1
I	1
don’t	1
believe	1
in	1
suicide,	1
nor	1
in	1
pure	1
accident,	1
myself.	1
It’s	1
more	1
likely	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
suffering	1
under	1
great	1
stress	1
of	1
mind,	1
and	1
took	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
things	1
about	1
him.	1
Perhaps	1
you	1
can	1
throw	1
some	1
light	1
on	1
these.”	1
He	1
took	1
from	1
his	1
pocket	1
a	1
little	1
packet	1
and	1
laid	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
table.	1
Carefully	1
undoing	1
it,	1
he	1
revealed	1
a	1
lady’s	1
handkerchief,	1
pinned	1
through	1
the	1
folds	1
with	1
a	1
pin	1
of	1
discoloured	1
Venetian	1
gold,	1
the	1
stone	1
of	1
which	1
had	1
fallen	1
from	1
the	1
socket.	1
A	1
scent	1
of	1
dried	1
violets	1
rose	1
to	1
young	1
Jolyon’s	1
nostrils.	1
“Found	1
in	1
his	1
breast	1
pocket,”	1
said	1
the	1
Inspector;	1
“the	1
name	1
has	1
been	1
cut	1
away!”	1
Young	1
Jolyon	1
with	1
difficulty	1
answered:	1
“I’m	1
afraid	1
I	1
cannot	1
help	1
you!”	1
But	1
vividly	1
there	1
rose	1
before	1
him	1
the	1
face	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
light	1
up,	1
so	1
tremulous	1
and	1
glad,	1
at	1
Bosinney’s	1
coming!	1
Of	1
her	1
he	1
thought	1
more	1
than	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
daughter,	1
more	1
than	1
of	1
them	1
all	1
—	1
of	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
dark,	1
soft	1
glance,	1
the	1
delicate	1
passive	1
face,	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
dead	1
man,	1
waiting	1
even	1
at	1
that	1
moment,	1
perhaps,	1
still	1
and	1
patient	1
in	1
the	1
sunlight.	1
He	1
walked	1
sorrowfully	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
hospital	1
towards	1
his	1
father’s	1
house,	1
reflecting	1
that	1
this	1
death	1
would	1
break	1
up	1
the	1
Forsyte	1
family.	1
The	1
stroke	1
had	1
indeed	1
slipped	1
past	1
their	1
defences	1
into	1
the	1
very	1
wood	1
of	1
their	1
tree.	1
They	1
might	1
flourish	1
to	1
all	1
appearance	1
as	1
before,	1
preserving	1
a	1
brave	1
show	1
before	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
London,	1
but	1
the	1
trunk	1
was	1
dead,	1
withered	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
flash	1
that	1
had	1
stricken	1
down	1
Bosinney.	1
And	1
now	1
the	1
saplings	1
would	1
take	1
its	1
place,	1
each	1
one	1
a	1
new	1
custodian	1
of	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
property.	1
Good	1
forest	1
of	1
Forsytes!	1
thought	1
young	1
Jolyon	1
—	1
soundest	1
timber	1
of	1
our	1
land!	1
Concerning	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
this	1
death	1
—	1
his	1
family	1
would	1
doubtless	1
reject	1
with	1
vigour	1
the	1
suspicion	1
of	1
suicide,	1
which	1
was	1
so	1
compromising!	1
They	1
would	1
take	1
it	1
as	1
an	1
accident,	1
a	1
stroke	1
of	1
fate.	1
In	1
their	1
hearts	1
they	1
would	1
even	1
feel	1
it	1
an	1
intervention	1
of	1
Providence,	1
a	1
retribution	1
—	1
had	1
not	1
Bosinney	1
endangered	1
their	1
two	1
most	1
priceless	1
possessions,	1
the	1
pocket	1
and	1
the	1
hearth?	1
And	1
they	1
would	1
talk	1
of	1
‘that	1
unfortunate	1
accident	1
of	1
young	1
Bosinney’s,’	1
but	1
perhaps	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
talk	1
—	1
silence	1
might	1
be	1
better!	1
As	1
for	1
himself,	1
he	1
regarded	1
the	1
bus-driver’s	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
accident	1
as	1
of	1
very	1
little	1
value.	1
For	1
no	1
one	1
so	1
madly	1
in	1
love	1
committed	1
suicide	1
for	1
want	1
of	1
money;	1
nor	1
was	1
Bosinney	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
fellow	1
to	1
set	1
much	1
store	1
by	1
a	1
financial	1
crisis.	1
And	1
so	1
he	1
too	1
rejected	1
this	1
theory	1
of	1
suicide,	1
the	1
dead	1
man’s	1
face	1
rose	1
too	1
clearly	1
before	1
him.	1
Gone	1
in	1
the	1
heyday	1
of	1
his	1
summer	1
—	1
and	1
to	1
believe	1
thus	1
that	1
an	1
accident	1
had	1
cut	1
Bosinney	1
off	1
in	1
the	1
full	1
sweep	1
of	1
his	1
passion	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
ever	1
pitiful	1
to	1
young	1
Jolyon.	1
Then	1
came	1
a	1
vision	1
of	1
Soames’	1
home	1
as	1
it	1
now	1
was,	1
and	1
must	1
be	1
hereafter.	1
The	1
streak	1
of	1
lightning	1
had	1
flashed	1
its	1
clear	1
uncanny	1
gleam	1
on	1
bare	1
bones	1
with	1
grinning	1
spaces	1
between,	1
the	1
disguising	1
flesh	1
was	1
gone.	1
.	3
In	1
the	1
dining-room	1
at	1
Stanhope	1
Gate	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
was	1
sitting	1
alone	1
when	1
his	1
son	1
came	1
in.	1
He	1
looked	1
very	1
wan	1
in	1
his	1
great	1
armchair.	1
And	1
his	1
eyes	1
travelling	1
round	1
the	1
walls	1
with	1
their	1
pictures	1
of	1
still	1
life,	1
and	1
the	1
masterpiece	1
‘Dutch	1
fishing-boats	1
at	1
Sunset’	1
seemed	1
as	1
though	1
passing	1
their	1
gaze	1
over	1
his	1
life	1
with	1
its	1
hopes,	1
its	1
gains,	1
its	1
achievements.	1
“Ah!	1
Jo!”	1
he	1
said,	1
“is	1
that	1
you?	1
I’ve	1
told	1
poor	1
little	1
June.	1
But	1
that’s	1
not	1
all	1
of	1
it.	1
Are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
Soames’?	1
She’s	1
brought	1
it	1
on	1
herself,	1
I	1
suppose;	1
but	1
somehow	1
I	1
can’t	1
bear	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
her,	1
shut	1
up	1
there	1
—	1
and	1
all	1
alone.”	1
And	1
holding	1
up	1
his	1
thin,	1
veined	1
hand,	1
he	1
clenched	1
it.	1
Chapter	1
32	1
Irene’s	1
Return	1
After	1
leaving	1
James	1
and	1
old	1
Jolyon	1
in	1
the	1
mortuary	1
of	1
the	1
hospital,	1
Soames	1
hurried	1
aimlessly	1
along	1
the	1
streets.	1
The	1
tragic	1
event	1
of	1
Bosinney’s	1
death	1
altered	1
the	1
complexion	1
of	1
everything.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
the	1
same	1
feeling	1
that	1
to	1
lose	1
a	1
minute	1
would	1
be	1
fatal,	1
nor	1
would	1
he	1
now	1
risk	1
communicating	1
the	1
fact	1
of	1
his	1
wife’s	1
flight	1
to	1
anyone	1
till	1
the	1
inquest	1
was	1
over.	1
That	1
morning	1
he	1
had	1
risen	1
early,	1
before	1
the	1
postman	1
came,	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
first-post	1
letters	1
from	1
the	1
box	1
himself,	1
and,	1
though	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
none	1
from	1
Irene,	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
telling	1
Bilson	1
that	1
her	1
mistress	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
sea;	1
he	1
would	1
probably,	1
he	1
said,	1
be	1
going	1
down	1
himself	1
from	1
Saturday	1
to	1
Monday.	1
This	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
time	1
to	1
breathe,	1
time	1
to	1
leave	1
no	1
stone	1
unturned	1
to	1
find	1
her.	1
But	1
now,	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
taking	1
steps	1
by	1
Bosinney’s	1
death	1
—	1
that	1
strange	1
death,	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
like	1
putting	1
a	1
hot	1
iron	1
to	1
his	1
heart,	1
like	1
lifting	1
a	1
great	1
weight	1
from	1
it	1
—	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
pass	1
his	1
day;	1
and	1
he	1
wandered	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
through	1
the	1
streets,	1
looking	1
at	1
every	1
face	1
he	1
met,	1
devoured	1
by	1
a	1
hundred	1
anxieties.	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
wandered,	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
him	1
who	1
had	1
finished	1
his	1
wandering,	1
his	1
prowling,	1
and	1
would	1
never	1
haunt	1
his	1
house	1
again.	1
Already	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon	1
he	1
passed	1
posters	1
announcing	1
the	1
identity	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
man,	1
and	1
bought	1
the	1
papers	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
they	1
said.	1
He	1
would	1
stop	1
their	1
mouths	1
if	1
he	1
could,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
City,	1
and	1
was	1
closeted	1
with	1
Boulter	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time.	1
On	1
his	1
way	1
home,	1
passing	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
Jobson’s	1
about	1
half	1
past	1
four,	1
he	1
met	1
George	1
Forsyte,	1
who	1
held	1
out	1
an	1
evening	1
paper	1
to	1
Soames,	1
saying:	1
“Here!	1
Have	1
you	1
seen	1
this	1
about	1
the	1
poor	1
Buccaneer?”	1
Soames	1
answered	1
stonily:	1
“Yes.”	1
George	1
stared	1
at	1
him.	1
He	1
had	1
never	1
liked	1
Soames;	1
he	1
now	1
held	1
him	1
responsible	1
for	1
Bosinney’s	1
death.	1
Soames	1
had	1
done	1
for	1
him	1
—	1
done	1
for	1
him	1
by	1
that	1
act	1
of	1
property	1
that	1
had	1
sent	1
the	1
Buccaneer	1
to	1
run	1
amok	1
that	1
fatal	1
afternoon.	1
‘The	1
poor	1
fellow,’	1
he	1
was	1
thinking,	1
‘was	1
so	1
cracked	1
with	1
jealousy,	1
so	1
cracked	1
for	1
his	1
vengeance,	1
that	1
he	1
heard	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
omnibus	1
in	1
that	1
infernal	1
fog.’	1
Soames	1
had	1
done	1
for	1
him!	1
And	1
this	1
judgment	1
was	1
in	1
George’s	1
eyes.	1
“They	1
talk	1
of	1
suicide	1
here,”	1
he	1
said	1
at	1
last.	1
“That	1
cat	1
won’t	1
jump.”	1
Soames	1
shook	1
his	1
head.	1
“An	1
accident,”	1
he	1
muttered.	1
Clenching	1
his	1
fist	1
on	1
the	1
paper,	1
George	1
crammed	1
it	1
into	1
his	1
pocket.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
resist	1
a	1
parting	1
shot.	1
“H’mm!	1
All	1
flourishing	1
at	1
home?	1
Any	1
little	1
Soameses	1
yet?”	1
With	1
a	1
face	1
as	1
white	1
as	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
Jobson’s,	1
and	1
a	1
lip	1
raised	1
as	1
if	1
snarling,	1
Soames	1
brushed	1
past	1
him	1
and	1
was	1
gone.	1
.	3
On	1
reaching	1
home,	1
and	1
entering	1
the	1
little	1
lighted	1
hall	1
with	1
his	1
latchkey,	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
that	1
caught	1
his	1
eye	1
was	1
his	1
wife’s	1
gold-mounted	1
umbrella	1
lying	1
on	1
the	1
rug	1
chest.	1
Flinging	1
off	1
his	1
fur	1
coat,	1
he	1
hurried	1
to	1
the	1
drawing-room.	1
The	1
curtains	1
were	1
drawn	1
for	1
the	1
night,	1
a	1
bright	1
fire	1
of	1
cedar-logs	1
burned	1
in	1
the	1
grate,	1
and	1
by	1
its	1
light	1
he	1
saw	1
Irene	1
sitting	1
in	1
her	1
usual	1
corner	1
on	1
the	1
sofa.	1
He	1
shut	1
the	1
door	1
softly,	1
and	1
went	1
towards	1
her.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
move,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
see	1
him.	1
“So	1
you’ve	1
come	1
back?”	1
he	1
said.	1
“Why	1
are	1
you	1
sitting	1
here	1
in	1
the	1
dark?”	1
Then	1
he	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
her	1
face,	1
so	1
white	1
and	1
motionless	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
though	1
the	1
blood	1
must	1
have	1
stopped	1
flowing	1
in	1
her	1
veins;	1
and	1
her	1
eyes,	1
that	1
looked	1
enormous,	1
like	1
the	1
great,	1
wide,	1
startled	1
brown	1
eyes	1
of	1
an	1
owl.	1
Huddled	1
in	1
her	1
grey	1
fur	1
against	1
the	1
sofa	1
cushions,	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
strange	1
resemblance	1
to	1
a	1
captive	1
owl,	1
bunched	1
fir	1
its	1
soft	1
feathers	1
against	1
the	1
wires	1
of	1
a	1
cage.	1
The	1
supple	1
erectness	1
of	1
her	1
figure	1
was	1
gone,	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
broken	1
by	1
cruel	1
exercise;	1
as	1
though	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
longer	1
any	1
reason	1
for	1
being	1
beautiful,	1
and	1
supple,	1
and	1
erect.	1
“So	1
you’ve	1
come	1
back,”	1
he	1
repeated.	1
She	1
never	1
looked	1
up,	1
and	1
never	1
spoke,	1
the	1
firelight	1
playing	1
over	1
her	1
motionless	1
figure.	1
Suddenly	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
rise,	1
but	1
he	1
prevented	1
her;	1
it	1
was	1
then	1
that	1
he	1
understood.	1
She	1
had	1
come	1
back	1
like	1
an	1
animal	1
wounded	1
to	1
death,	1
not	1
knowing	1
where	1
to	1
turn,	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
doing.	1
The	1
sight	1
of	1
her	1
figure,	1
huddled	1
in	1
the	1
fur,	1
was	1
enough.	1
He	1
knew	1
then	1
for	1
certain	1
that	1
Bosinney	1
had	1
been	1
her	1
lover;	1
knew	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
report	1
of	1
his	1
death	1
—	1
perhaps,	1
like	1
himself,	1
had	1
bought	1
a	1
paper	1
at	1
the	1
draughty	1
corner	1
of	1
a	1
street,	1
and	1
read	1
it.	1
She	1
had	1
come	1
back	1
then	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
accord,	1
to	1
the	1
cage	1
she	1
had	1
pined	1
to	1
be	1
free	1
of	1
—	1
and	1
taking	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
tremendous	1
significance	1
of	1
this,	1
he	1
longed	1
to	1
cry:	1
“Take	1
your	1
hated	1
body,	1
that	1
I	1
love,	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
house!	1
Take	1
away	1
that	1
pitiful	1
white	1
face,	1
so	1
cruel	1
and	1
soft	1
—	1
before	1
I	1
crush	1
it.	1
Get	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
sight;	1
never	1
let	1
me	1
see	1
you	1
again!”	1
And,	1
at	1
those	1
unspoken	1
words,	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
rise	1
and	1
move	1
away,	1
like	1
a	1
woman	1
in	1
a	1
terrible	1
dream,	1
from	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
fighting	1
to	1
awake	1
—	1
rise	1
and	1
go	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
dark	1
and	1
cold,	1
without	1
a	1
thought	1
of	1
him,	1
without	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
his	1
presence.	1
Then	1
he	1
cried,	1
contradicting	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
spoken,	1
“No;	1
stay	1
there!”	1
And	1
turning	1
away	1
from	1
her,	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
his	1
accustomed	1
chair	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
hearth.	1
They	1
sat	1
in	1
silence.	1
And	1
Soames	1
thought:	1
‘Why	1
is	1
all	1
this?	1
Why	1
should	1
I	1
suffer	1
so?	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
done?	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
my	1
fault!’	1
Again	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
her,	1
huddled	1
like	1
a	1
bird	1
that	1
is	1
shot	1
and	1
dying,	1
whose	1
poor	1
breast	1
you	1
see	1
panting	1
as	1
the	1
air	1
is	1
taken	1
from	1
it,	1
whose	1
poor	1
eyes	1
look	1
at	1
you	1
who	1
have	1
shot	1
it,	1
with	1
a	1
slow,	1
soft,	1
unseeing	1
look,	1
taking	1
farewell	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
good	1
—	1
of	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
the	1
air,	1
and	1
its	1
mate.	1
So	1
they	1
sat,	1
by	1
the	1
firelight,	1
in	1
the	1
silence,	1
one	1
on	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
hearth.	1
And	1
the	1
fume	1
of	1
the	1
burning	1
cedar	1
logs,	1
that	1
he	1
loved	1
so	1
well,	1
seemed	1
to	1
grip	1
Soames	1
by	1
the	1
throat	1
till	1
he	1
could	1
bear	1
it	1
no	1
longer.	1
And	1
going	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
hall	1
he	1
flung	1
the	1
door	1
wide,	1
to	1
gulp	1
down	1
the	1
cold	1
air	1
that	1
came	1
in;	1
then	1
without	1
hat	1
or	1
overcoat	1
went	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
Square.	1
Along	1
the	1
garden	1
rails	1
a	1
half-starved	1
cat	1
came	1
rubbing	1
her	1
way	1
towards	1
him,	1
and	1
Soames	1
thought:	1
‘Suffering!	1
when	1
will	1
it	1
cease,	1
my	1
suffering?’	1
At	1
a	1
front	1
door	1
across	1
the	1
way	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
his	1
acquaintance	1
named	1
Rutter,	1
scraping	1
his	1
boots,	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
‘I	1
am	1
master	1
here.’	1
And	1
Soames	1
walked	1
on.	1
From	1
far	1
in	1
the	1
clear	1
air	1
the	1
bells	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
where	1
he	1
and	1
Irene	1
had	1
been	1
married	1
were	1
pealing	1
in	1
‘practice’	1
for	1
the	1
advent	1
of	1
Christ,	1
the	1
chimes	1
ringing	1
out	1
above	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
traffic.	1
He	1
felt	1
a	1
craving	1
for	1
strong	1
drink,	1
to	1
lull	1
him	1
to	1
indifference,	1
or	1
rouse	1
him	1
to	1
fury.	1
If	1
only	1
he	1
could	1
burst	1
out	1
of	1
himself,	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
web	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
in	1
his	1
life	1
he	1
felt	1
around	1
him.	1
If	1
only	1
he	1
could	1
surrender	1
to	1
the	1
thought:	1
‘Divorce	1
her	1
—	1
turn	1
her	1
out!	1
She	1
has	1
forgotten	1
you.	1
Forget	1
her!’	1
If	1
only	1
he	1
could	1
surrender	1
to	1
the	1
thought:	1
‘Let	1
her	1
go	1
—	1
she	1
has	1
suffered	1
enough!’	1
If	1
only	1
he	1
could	1
surrender	1
to	1
the	1
desire:	1
‘Make	1
a	1
slave	1
of	1
her	1
—	1
she	1
is	1
in	1
your	1
power!’	1
If	1
only	1
even	1
he	1
could	1
surrender	1
to	1
the	1
sudden	1
vision:	1
‘What	1
does	1
it	1
all	1
matter?’	1
Forget	1
himself	1
for	1
a	1
minute,	1
forget	1
that	1
it	1
mattered	1
what	1
he	1
did,	1
forget	1
that	1
whatever	1
he	1
did	1
he	1
must	1
sacrifice	1
something.	1
If	1
only	1
he	1
could	1
act	1
on	1
an	1
impulse!	1
He	1
could	1
forget	1
nothing;	1
surrender	1
to	1
no	1
thought,	1
vision,	1
or	1
desire;	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
too	1
serious;	1
too	1
close	1
around	1
him,	1
an	1
unbreakable	1
cage.	1
On	1
the	1
far	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
Square	1
newspaper	1
boys	1
were	1
calling	1
their	1
evening	1
wares,	1
and	1
the	1
ghoulish	1
cries	1
mingled	1
and	1
jangled	1
with	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
those	1
church	1
bells.	1
Soames	1
covered	1
his	1
ears.	1
The	1
thought	1
flashed	1
across	1
him	1
that	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
chance,	1
he	1
himself,	1
and	1
not	1
Bosinney,	1
might	1
be	1
lying	1
dead,	1
and	1
she,	1
instead	1
of	1
crouching	1
there	1
like	1
a	1
shot	1
bird	1
with	1
those	1
dying	1
eyes.	1
.	3
Something	1
soft	1
touched	1
his	1
legs,	1
the	1
cat	1
was	1
rubbing	1
herself	1
against	1
them.	1
And	1
a	1
sob	1
that	1
shook	1
him	1
from	1
head	1
to	1
foot	1
burst	1
from	1
Soames’	1
chest.	1
Then	1
all	1
was	1
still	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
dark,	1
where	1
the	1
houses	1
seemed	1
to	1
stare	1
at	1
him,	1
each	1
with	1
a	1
master	1
and	1
mistress	1
of	1
its	1
own,	1
and	1
a	1
secret	1
story	1
of	1
happiness	1
or	1
sorrow.	1
And	1
suddenly	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
his	1
own	1
door	1
was	1
open,	1
and	1
black	1
against	1
the	1
light	1
from	1
the	1
hall	1
a	1
man	1
standing	1
with	1
his	1
back	1
turned.	1
Something	1
slid	1
too	1
in	1
his	1
breast,	1
and	1
he	1
stole	1
up	1
close	1
behind.	1
He	1
could	1
see	1
his	1
own	1
fur	1
coat	1
flung	1
across	1
the	1
carved	1
oak	1
chair;	1
the	1
Persian	1
rugs;	1
the	1
silver	1
bowls,	1
the	1
rows	1
of	1
porcelain	1
plates	1
arranged	1
along	1
the	1
walls,	1
and	1
this	1
unknown	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
standing	1
there.	1
And	1
sharply	1
he	1
asked:	1
“What	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
want,	1
sir?”	1
The	1
visitor	1
turned.	1
It	1
was	1
young	1
Jolyon.	1
“The	1
door	1
was	1
open,”	1
he	1
said.	1
“Might	1
I	1
see	1
your	1
wife	1
for	1
a	1
minute,	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
message	1
for	1
her?”	1
Soames	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
strange,	1
sidelong	1
stare.	1
“My	1
wife	1
can	1
see	1
no	1
one,”	1
he	1
muttered	1
doggedly.	1
Young	1
Jolyon	1
answered	1
gently:	1
“I	1
shouldn’t	1
keep	1
her	1
a	1
minute.”	1
Soames	1
brushed	1
by	1
him	1
and	1
barred	1
the	1
way.	1
“She	1
can	1
see	1
no	1
one,”	1
he	1
said	1
again.	1
Young	1
Jolyon’s	1
glance	1
shot	1
past	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
hall,	1
and	1
Soames	1
turned.	1
There	1
in	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
doorway	1
stood	1
Irene,	1
her	1
eyes	1
were	1
wild	1
and	1
eager,	1
her	1
lips	1
were	1
parted,	1
her	1
hands	1
outstretched.	1
In	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
both	1
men	1
that	1
light	1
vanished	1
from	1
her	1
face;	1
her	1
hands	1
dropped	1
to	1
her	1
sides;	1
she	1
stood	1
like	1
stone.	1
Soames	1
spun	1
round,	1
and	1
met	1
his	1
visitor’s	1
eyes,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
look	1
he	1
saw	1
in	1
them,	1
a	1
sound	1
like	1
a	1
snarl	1
escaped	1
him.	1
He	1
drew	1
his	1
lips	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
ghost	1
of	1
a	1
smile.	1
“This	1
is	1
my	1
house,”	1
he	1
said;	1
“I	1
manage	1
my	1
own	1
affairs.	1
I’ve	1
told	1
you	1
once	1
—	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
again;	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
at	1
home.”	1
And	1
in	1
young	1
Jolyon’s	1
face	1
he	1
slammed	1
the	1
door.	1
The	1
End	1
